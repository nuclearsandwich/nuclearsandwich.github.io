  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pry.github.com">Pry</a> is an alternative interactive Ruby environment
similar to IRB. In addition to looking a little nicer through nearly live
colorization, Pry offers some pretty powerful features for exploring, modifying,
and debugging Ruby applications in a live system.</p>

<p>Pry&#8217;s namesake ability to &#8220;pry&#8221; open an object is not limited to debugging use.
It&#8217;s actually a really straightforward way to build any kind of domain specific
REPL. I think I just coined that term but it fits well and you&#8217;ll soon see why.</p>

<h2>The Backstory</h2>

<p>When I working at <a href="http://nowbox.com">NOWBOX</a> I spent a lot of time hitting our
API during ad-hoc testing. I was doing enough of this that just using curl
wasn&#8217;t cutting it.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, curl is awesome and super useful. But it lacks a few
niceties. Chief among them curl, like HTTP, is stateless without the use of
cookie files and given that we were using a token-based authentication system,
simulating device-API interaction using exclusively curl was neither fun nor
easy.</p>

<p>During this time, we were also using
<a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-test">Rack::Test</a>, which I really like. It&#8217;s a
solid and purposeful DSL and great at what it does. What it isn&#8217;t good at is
being interactive. I&#8217;d get colourful explosions(stacktraces) whenever I tried to
pry into and look at a test using <code>Rack::Test</code>.</p>

<p>We already had the awesome <a href="https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday">Faraday</a>
included in our project, so I hacked together a quick rake task that would set
up a <code>Faraday::Connection</code> and pry into it. What did this get me? I now had my
interactive <code>Rack::Test</code>.</p>

<h2>Building the Gem</h2>

<p>Pry made this really easy. So easy that later on, when I wanted to rewrite the
above code and turn it into a reusable gem I kept the same strategy.</p>

<p>I build my DSL class, <code>Cage::Console</code>, which also handles all the initialization
such as config file loading and default values for variables. It also overloads
some of Pry&#8217;s settings to get a more interesting prompt string and suppressing
they default <code>~/.pryrc</code> config file loading.</p>

<p>The rest of the class is the domain specific stuff that deals with delegating to
the Faraday connection object and building the response object. I built my own
wrapper around Faraday&#8217;s response so I could improve how they are displayed as
return values.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly verbose but the primary function is to show you the complete
result of an HTTP request, which it does.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s  basically all there is to it. This feature of Pry that&#8217;s mainly
advertised as a way to get hands-on with your objects for debugging is also a
great way to build a domain specific or domain focused interactive environment.
Depending on how much you want to customize Pry&#8217;s interface you don&#8217;t even need
a thorough understanding of Pry&#8217;s internals. If you&#8217;re more interested in the
features <em>of</em> Cage than the mechanics of its construction you can install it
from RubyGems using <code>gem install cage</code> or check out its <a href="/cage">project page</a>.
The complete source for Cage is on
<a href="https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/cage">GitHub</a>. I hope you use Pry and Cage
to build awesome stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood wrote an article this morning called <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">Please Don&#8217;t Learn to Code</a>.
He addresses some serious problems with the way we present programming to the
external world, which is probably comes from a desire to dress up what we do as
cooler than plumbing. But he goes a step too far telling people <em>not</em> to learn
something. Programming ability is not a ticket to a magical land of unicorns,
fairies and premier upper-middle class salaries. Programming is diverting,
challenging, and interesting. It&#8217;s a great thing to make a career out of, but
also a fantastic hobby. There are many reasons to learn to program no matter who
you are. I&#8217;ve been preparing that article for ages and will hopefully finish it
some time after I&#8217;ve calmed down. There is a difference between a software
developer (engineer, if you prefer) and someone who knows how to program. I can&#8217;t
speak for &#8220;the movement&#8221; although, I&#8217;m pleased as punch that there is one but I
can say that aside from being honest about how much I make writing software and
how I learned what enables me to earn that I have never told someone the reason
to learn programming was to rake in the cash.</p>

<h4>The Mayor Learns to Program</h4>

<p>His opening remarks jab at the Mayor of New York&#8217;s supposed new year&#8217;s
resolution to learn to code suggesting we&#8217;d end up with</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>10 PRINT "I AM MAYOR"
</span><span class='line'>20 GOTO 10</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If Mayor Bloomberg gets that far, it would actually be awesome. I&#8217;m not
suggesting he spend his mayoral days learning Javascript but everyone has
nights, weekends, and hobbies. I&#8217;m sure the mayor of New York can afford to have
quite a few.</p>

<p>Mr. Atwood, I don&#8217;t want everyone to become a crack Java developer. I wouldn&#8217;t
wish that on my worst nemesis. What I want is for anyone with even a passing
interest in how computer software works to have access to tools and materials
they need to learn more about it as they please. And we don&#8217;t have that yet.
<a href="http://codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a> is doing an excellent job getting us closer and should be
applauded for doing so.</p>

<h4>Programming as a Life Skill</h4>

<blockquote><p>It is obvious to me how being a skilled reader, a skilled writer, and at least
high school level math are fundamental to performing the job of a politician.
Or at any job, for that matter. But understanding variables and functions,
pointers and recursion?</p></blockquote>

<p>Here you&#8217;re comparing big things (reading, writing, and mathematics) to little
things (variables, pointers, and functions). The individual concepts are of
little importance the same way homophones and perfect grammar are of little
importance. But how deeply can you trust a politician&#8217;s reasoning about software
and technology if they lack even a basic understanding about how that computer
works. There&#8217;s a startling <em>lack</em> of digital literacy among people outside of
software engineering and there are people trying to break down those barriers
and get the interesting and <em>relevant</em> information out there in understandable
ways.</p>

<p>Programming is absolutely not on the same level as reading or arithmetic
however, does your argument for not teaching it in schools then extend to arts
and music? Surely they are not as basic a skill as reading and arithmetic yet we
still perceive some value in teaching them to children.</p>

<p>You said yourself that a software developer&#8217;s job is to solve problems. Well
what is a JavaScript interpreter but an abstract problem solving sandbox? Is
there a specific reason you <em>don&#8217;t</em> want problem solving to be a general skill?
Are you frightened of our field losing status as the only problem solvers?</p>

<p>The critical thinking skills that I started developing when I started learning
to code are what sustain me both physically and mentally. I would love to be
teaching these skills in elementary school for that reason alone. Programming is
engaging, and while it won&#8217;t engage everyone, we should at least be providing
the same opportunities we used to afford music, art, and wood shop. How many
people who took wood shop in high school went on to become carpenters? Probably
not many. But how many gained some level of appreciation for the craft? I&#8217;m sure
that number is far higher. I didn&#8217;t have wood shop at my high school, but I was
fortunate in that my father, uncle, and grandfather all work with wood in
various capacities and that allowed me to see how enjoyable and creative the
process is.</p>

<h4>In Which We are Likened to Plumbers</h4>

<blockquote><p>I can also recognize plumbing problems when I see them without any
particular training in the area.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, it doesn&#8217;t take a plumber to notice a clogged toilet. Just like it doesn&#8217;t
take a web developer to recognize that <code>404 Not Found</code> or <code>500 Internal Server
Error</code> means something went wrong but can you do anything about that clog
without a plunger? And where did you learn to use it? Unless you were born with
the knowledge of the existence and use of plungers, someone showed you how to
use it. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m advocating here. Teach everyone to use the plungers of
coding. It&#8217;s interesting to remark however, that there is very little someone
with a programming plunger can fix.  It takes so much more to get any real work
done. So why bother? A little bit of understanding never killed anyone and
you&#8217;ll have at least some basic understanding of what your programmer is doing
for you if you know how tough it is to</p>

<h4>Wrapping Up</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m about to arrive in my last operating systems class of the year, so I need to
go and I want to publish this while I&#8217;m still caffeinated and disappointed
enough to go head-on against one of the authors and developers whom I deeply
respect. Much of your argument is extremely valid and the &#8220;everyone should
learn programming&#8221; {initiative,movement,meme} should accept this criticism,
which I do, and synthesize it so that we can better reach our goal.</p>

<p>However, you&#8217;ve thrown the baby out with the bathwater in your haste to put a
stop to misinformation and are losing a really powerful way to engage inquiring
minds of all ages with a deeply interesting and modern art, computer
programming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I walked into class yesterday afternoon where my professor teaches, back-to-back, a
section of upper division Data Structures and Algorithms followed by my section
of Formal Languages and Automata. On Monday, both classes had an exam. (Not my
best I&#8217;m afraid, I spent the weekend at
<a href="http://farmhouse.la/conf">FarmhouseConf</a> rather than studying. Worth it.) I
arrived to class today and overheard a familiar story as the last class was
leaving. A student was contesting his score on a particular problem. The
crux of his reasoning was that while he <em>was</em> wrong, he &#8220;felt&#8221; he &#8220;earned more
points&#8221; than what was recorded. I&#8217;m normally not a fan of the air-quotes for
emphasis or sarcasm, but in this case they were also the exact words used by the
student in question.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s something odd about people who pay attention to the points rather than
what they learned. I will be the first to jump in and bitch about how much I pay
for tuition but also freely admit that I pay far less than an out-of-state or
private school student. School is fucking expensive. So why? Why why why why
<em>why?</em> would you haggle over how many points you &#8220;earned&#8221;, when you can and
should be figuring out what you didn&#8217;t learn which cost you those points. On
tests where I do poorly, I often spend about as much time trying to figure out
what I did wrong as I did taking the test in the first place. I&#8217;m also a really
shitty student. I elect not to take notes and I am presently writing the first
draft of this post in class while something I already know is being reviewed.</p>

<p>Situations like this one baffle me, but also emphasizes that there&#8217;s no metric I
can use other than day-to-day individual progress to represent the achievements
of my students lest they (or I) become fixated on the metric. I keep incredibly
detailed notes about the individual skills and weak points of anyone who I
regularly teach or mentor, but I neither have nor will try to grade or rate
them. Why fixate on numerals when you could fixate on learning new stuff?</p>

<p>The vocabulary choices of this student remind me of something my seventh grade
history teacher talked about on the first day of school. Which is the subtle and
subconscious vocabulary choices of students when discussing grades. &#8220;I got an A.
I got an A. He <em>gave</em> me an F.&#8221; It&#8217;s only human to want to take credit for our
achievements while marginalizing our failures. I have certainly been guilty of
this in the past. I have <strike>been given</strike> achieved three failing
grades in my life, two in high school and one in college.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>I earned</em> an F in second semester Geometry because I failed to find the
subject interesting and couldn&#8217;t be arsed to do the homework or get up before
7AM to get to class on time.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I earned</em> an F in second semester American History because I elected to take
no notes in spite of the fact that our notebooks were going to be collected
and graded.</p></li>
<li><p>Incidentally, the one college course I failed was an online Jazz History
course during a winter session. I failed because I completely forgot I
registered. I never signed in or even thought about it until it showed up on
my transcript.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I don&#8217;t look too far down on this guy though. When <em>I</em> was taking the very same
Data Structures class, albeit with a different professor, we were required to
submit our assignments online to a system which auto-grades our programming
assignments by running our own JUnit tests, and analyzing them for coverage. As
well as JUnit tests written by our professor on our code. One thing the system
did that I absolutely hated was run Checkstyle with the official SJSU Java Style
guidelines encoded in XML. Well, this style guide was written before Java had
Generics and had never been updated. So Checkstyle threw a fit when I had
<code>Node&lt;E&gt;</code> instead of <code>Node &lt; E &gt;</code>. In order to get it to shut up (and claim the
final five points on the assignment) I had to ruin my code with this offensively
spaced style.</p>

<p>I mentioned this to the professor and he suggested that it was always an option
to sacrifice those points in the name of doing things right and grades be
damned. Since then, I&#8217;ve submitted plenty of assignments that don&#8217;t precisely
meet specification. Mostly I get docked because I don&#8217;t include Eclipse project
files with my source code which means the professors have to find the command
line and run Ant (I also provide Makefiles). In any case, it was eye opening to
hear a professor give me permission to get a less-than-optimal score simply
because something else is more important.</p>

<p>So stop counting your points and start making sure you learn. Besides, learning
is more fun.</p>

make available to the general public.</p>

<p><em>That is all</em></p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve read two really excellent books. <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/kcdc/the-developer-s-code">The Developer&#8217;s Code</a> by Ka
Wai Cheung, and <a href="http://www.codesimplicity.com/">Code Simplicity</a> by Max Kanat-Alexander. I should start off
by saying that they were both great (and short!) reads and I&#8217;d recommend either
of them to anyone. Particularly young developers still getting their first five
years&#8217; experience(1). Though I&#8217;ve been reading a <a href="https://trello.com/board/i-heart-books/4e7238ede06bdd000002d5e1">fair few</a> books in between
these two, something about them struck me as similar. Given that it&#8217;s been
months since I read The Developer&#8217;s Code and no review materialized, I figured
I&#8217;d give some brief words about each book now.</p>

<h2>The Developer&#8217;s Code</h2>

<p>This book is aimed at younger developers, or even folks who haven&#8217;t yet decided
to become software developers. It gives a pretty good overview of the industry
in which we work and how it&#8217;s perceived. The author seems utterly enamored with
code generation and found a way to bring it up in nearly every chapter. I&#8217;m not
really a fan of it at all unless it&#8217;s the runtime kind of code generation.
However, it&#8217;s largely incidental to the work as a whole. Lastly, chapter 6
discusses teaching and <em>every single one of you must read it now</em>. It&#8217;s not
even eight pages and yet he collects a handful of techniques it has taken me
more seven years of instructing(2) to be able to put to words. The book was
worth the full price to see these words written in front of me. If you need to
borrow it, let me know. <a href="http://twitter.com/sgharms">@sgharms</a> has my copy right
now.</p>

<h2>Code Simplicity</h2>

<p>I will admit to buying this book as an impulse buy because the ebook was
half-off on <a href="http:///oreilly.com">O&#8217;Reilly.com</a>. I&#8217;m ever so glad I did though
as it&#8217;s been a very easy and enjoyable read. At first I felt the method of
describing the author&#8217;s observations as Laws was considerably presumptive
behavior. However, like the laws of gravity and motion in the physics world, the
precise wordings have genericity<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_property">(3)</a> and a timeless quality. One of the
stand-out aspects of this book to my mind was the complete absence of software
testing until the very last law of the book. I was impressed by this because as
I&#8217;ve <a href="/blog/2011/10/28/there-are-10-types-of-tests-you-need-both-of-them/">written before</a>, testing is not itself an end, it is a means to the end
of successful, quality software that performs its duty of helping people.
Throughout the book there is discussion of evidence and verification, from which
testing should arise naturally. While I respect the author&#8217;s desire to add a
specific law of software testing, I think it could be omitted as a duplicate in
a <a href="http://youtu.be/p-RGN21TSGk">George Carlin-esque</a> fashion.</p>

<p>Thanks for your eyes,</p>

<p>Steven!</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> I&#8217;m talking <em>real</em> experience. Not LOL I was writing C64 machine language in
the womb by tugging on the umbilical cord in binary Morse code.</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> When I was sixteen, I was reassigned from lifeguarding to teaching
photography at the boy scout camp where I was working. I had no idea at the
time, but the shake-up resulted in the discovery of two of the great passions in
my life, photography and teaching. I went on in subsequent years to teach
lifeguarding, teach teaching lifeguarding, and now teach programming and
software development to whomever I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was about to ask a question on Identi.ca and Twitter, when I realized I would
probably be flamed into oblivion if I didn&#8217;t explain myself in more than 140
characters.</p>

<p>My question: <strong>Why are we still typing <code>rake db:migrate</code> instead of <code>rails
db:migrate</code>?</strong></p>

<p>Before you scoff and walk away. Hear me out. I <em>get</em> that Rake is a more general
tool than Rails and we can use it to automate all sorts of cool tasks. In fact
I&#8217;ve been using Rake to do all kinds of bonkers stuff in my projects since I
first started learning Ruby. Teaching at <a href="http://railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> this weekend, I had a
surprisingly high number of students ask &#8220;What is rake?&#8221;. I was really happy
when I got this question so much because it means that they&#8217;re actually thinking
about what they&#8217;re typing, which is hugely important. Each time it was asked, my
smile quickly faded. What should I tell them. &#8220;Rake is Ruby&#8217;s Make, It&#8217;s like
make but in Ruby.&#8221; would work for anyone who has been using or programming UNIX
for any significant amount of time, but for many Railsbridge students (and many
people learning Rails), Ruby is what will expose them to all of that, so we
can&#8217;t use it as the base of our teaching metaphor(1).</p>

<p>I settled for &#8220;Rake is a tool for automating common tasks in a project. The name
comes from a program called make, but since Rake is written in Ruby, it&#8217;s Rake.&#8221;</p>

<p>While my students seemed satisfied with that answer, I sure wasn&#8217;t. The whole
purpose of Railsbridge is to demystify programming and software development.
We&#8217;re not trying to build an army of new software developers (but I&#8217;d love to),
just trying to grant people some basic coding literacy and comfort. Trying to do
this in an environment where some commands start with <code>rake</code> (assets:precompile
is another culprit) and others with <code>rails</code> and the only way to know which is to
be in the club already or have someone tell you is suboptimal.</p>

<p>So, developers, why are Rails&#8217;s built in Rake tasks still Rake tasks and should
we start the discussion of baking them into the Rails command for Rails 4.0?
Without a better answer than &#8220;it&#8217;s always been that way&#8221;, I think we should.</p>

<p>(1) More information and musings on them forthcoming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With increasing frequency, I&#8217;ve been afforded the opportunity to teach people
who are completely new to programming and this inevitably leads to me espousing
my preferred method for learning anything: Making an assumption and verifying or
refuting it through experimentation.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had the pleasure of teaching two fantastic burgeoning developers the
concept of method composition in Ruby. For experienced developers, it is as
natural as breathing, but too often our memories of our early programming
experiences are clouded over with the same terror we see in the eyes of our
students.</p>

<p>At almost every stage there were simple questions, questions it would have taken
me seconds to address had I given a direct answer. But learning to program (or
do much else) needs to go deeper than just assembling facts. In order to do
well, we have to have our own mental interpreters and compilers and process the
code in our minds. The sooner we start developing this trait in new programmers,
the better off they&#8217;ll be. So my general answer was</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, what do you <em>think</em> will happen?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Queue audience groan. By asking this ad nauseum and forcing them to give me an
answer before hitting enter, I&#8217;m contributing in a real way to building their
mind&#8217;s Ruby interpreter.</p>

<p>If this sounds eerily like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a>, that&#8217;s because it is! We
just condensed it for tiny, one or two line experiments in Ruby!</p>

<h2>Not Just for N00bs</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve finally started reading <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> and one of the very first exercises
revealed one of my achilles&#8217; heels.</p>

<p>I was asked to give the value of the evaluated expression below:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='scheme'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">- </span><span class="mi">9</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can <em>never</em> remember what this shakes out to. Is it <code>9 - 1 = 8</code> or <code>1 - 9 =
-8</code>? I didn&#8217;t know off the top of my head. But before I fired up Racket to see
what the answer was, I forced myself to make a guess. Would it be 8, or -8? My
guess was 8.</p>

<p>Only after forming that hypothesis did I throw that expression into an
interpreter.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it does evaluate to <code>8</code>. <strong><em>Assumption Verified! A winner
is me!</em></strong> Would it have mattered if I&#8217;d been wrong? Not really, I would have
learned the same lesson.</p>

<p>The rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test Driven Development</a> is actually the rise of the application
(in a very minor and partial way) of the scientific method in Software Engineering.
We&#8217;re making assumptions about the goals (end-to-end tests) and design (unit
tests) of our software and codifying them in form of our tests. These get
challenged and verified or refuted whenever we run our tests. As our software
changes, so do our hypotheses around it.</p>

<p>So regardless of whether you&#8217;re writing code for the first time, or a veteran
software developer, take the advice of John and John of They Might Be Giants,
<em>you need a test</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://clojurewest.org">Clojure/west</a> was last weekend. Needless to say it was a blast! I learned a
ton and as ever, am totally charged up and excited to hack on a bunch of crazy
ideas. One of the highlights of the weekend was participating in the Swarm
Coding event led by <a href="https://github.com/technomancy">@technomancy</a>. If you were in the rogue Vim group I was
hosting, I did eventually get the source up on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/vimswarm">here</a>.</p>

<p>For others, is anyone interested in attending a South Bay Area Swarm Coding
night once every couple of weeks or so? Since I&#8217;m the one putting it forward, I
suggest we go somewhere in Santa Clara (I have a number of ideas as to where)
but I&#8217;m also open to other areas so long as they don&#8217;t crawl too far North. It&#8217;s
not that I don&#8217;t love San Francisco but it&#8217;s hard to get up there with school.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, I&#8217;m attempting to schedule the first one for some night
the week of April 1st through 7th. If you&#8217;re not sure what Swarm Coding is,
check out Phil&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojurewest2012-slides/blob/master/Hagelberg-SwarmCoding.pdf?raw=true">slides (pdf)</a> from Clojure/west. In short, everyone logs into a
shared tmux session running either Vim or Emacs and all collaborate on a
project.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be disuaded if you&#8217;ve never programmed in Clojure before, it&#8217;s actually a
really fun way to learn no matter what your initial skill level is. If there&#8217;s a
quorum of newcomers, we can also do a session on tooling before diving into the
code.</p>

<p>Does this sound like the best idea? I haven&#8217;t bothered to set up a mailing list
or anything so if you&#8217;re interested hit me up on <a href="https://identi.ca/nuclearsandwich">Identi.ca</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nuclearsandwich">Twitter</a>, or
good old <a href="mailto://steven@nuclearsandwich.com">email</a> and let me know which day of the week works best for you.
Then I&#8217;ll cast the information back out to everyone.</p>

<p>Come on out and have fun making Clojure stuff!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Clojure/west is only feeding us lunch on Friday. That leaves us to our own
devices for Friday&#8217;s dinner, after-after-party drinks, Saturday&#8217;s lunch,
dinner, and drinks.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Clojure/west&#8217;s website lists the official guide from the city of
San Jose, which includes a lot of duds and places far away from the conference
venue. There&#8217;s not much I like about Downtown San José but the few things I do
enjoy are places to eat and drink.</p>

<p>For the impatient, <a href="http://g.co/maps/r8kcf">here&#8217;s the map</a> of everything.</p>

<p>As a student at San José State, I spend a lot of time in this part of town and
have compiled a short list of places to eat and drink while you&#8217;re in town for
the conference. If you&#8217;re venturing further afield than downtown or just want to
hang out. I exist on the Twitters as
<a href="https://twitter.com/nuclearsandwich">@nuclearsandwich</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve included below a description of my usual haunts and a like to Google&#8217;s
walking directions from the conference hotel.</p>

<h3>Good Karma</h3>

<p>To my mind, <a href="http://g.co/maps/j342r">Good Karma</a> is the best food in Downtown
San José. Yes it&#8217;s a vegan restaurant but the food is stellar. They have a
selection of entrées such as Spicy Basil Tofu and Chana Masala which they serve
on a plate with brown rice and house gravy, or in a wrap. The spicy basil tofu
and Pra-Ram are my favorites at the moment. The other best thing about Good
Karma is their amazing beer selection. Even if you don&#8217;t make it out for the
food, treat yourself to a good beer. I wrote most of this article from Good
Karma. If you&#8217;re an IPA fan, Good Karma currently has a host of exceptional IPAs
including Russian River&#8217;s Pliny the Elder, one of my favorites in the genre.</p>

<h3>La Lune Sucrée</h3>

<p><a href="http://g.co/maps/6ckzq">La Lune Sucrée</a> only opened up recently. It&#8217;s above
average for a student&#8217;s lunch and I generally consider coming here a treat. They
have a number of French staples such as croque-monsieur which I cannot speak
toward, but their Apple and Brie (with ham if you want it) sandwich has walnuts
and cranberries and is quite yummy as is the vegetable quiche. They also have
one of my favorite ginger ales but it comes in massive one liter bottles.</p>

<h3>Single Barrel</h3>

<p><a href="http://g.co/maps/sh5mk">Single Barrel</a> is cocktail heaven. Your first drink
here, you&#8217;re not allowed to order from the menu and you&#8217;ll probably never want
to. Instead your bartender is going to ask you what sort of flavors you enjoy
and through a serious of questions, arrive at a cocktail that suits you well.
Come in the mood to relax and take your time with the drinks here as they aren&#8217;t
cheap. Also be warned that they don&#8217;t take groups larger than six since it is a
speakeasy in a low-ceilinged basement. They have chess, checkers, Connect Four,
and Scrabble so long as you keep the volume down.</p>

<h3>Tandoori Oven</h3>

<p><a href="http://g.co/maps/x6md8">Tandori Oven</a> is mostly here because some of you won&#8217;t
want to eat at Good Karma for every meal. I&#8217;ve eaten here once or twice and
never been disappointed, but there&#8217;s better Indian closer to where I live so
this restaurant is not in my regular rotation.</p>

<h3>Satori Tea Bar</h3>

<p><a href="http://g.co/maps/2bv9c">Satori Tea Bar</a> isn&#8217;t a place to eat lunch or dinner
and the hours are quite restricted. However, if you need to take a break and go
somewhere quiet and contemplative where you can drink delicious oolongs and rare
greens or try the delicious guayusa, which is similar to yerba mate but sweeter.</p>

<p>A quick stop at Satori for tea to go would also be nice walking back from the
Mmmoon</p>

<h3>The Mmmoon</h3>

<p>Despite its silly name, <a href="http://g.co/maps/shze2">The Mmmoon</a> makes really
delicious empanadas both sweet and savory. The sauce they use is quite unique
and although I&#8217;ve seen it in a number of other empanada restaurants throughout
the Bay Area, this is the best one I&#8217;ve had. Lunch here can be cheap and
filling. They also deliver within five miles of their location which includes
the conference venue.</p>

<h3>Grande Pizzeria</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve only eaten at <a href="http://g.co/maps/nxcpq">Grande</a> because the school regularly
hosts mixers with IBM, Cisco, and NetApp here. The pizza is alright and they
have a few &#8220;good enough&#8221; beers and an inexpensive happy hour that coincides with
the dinner break.</p>

<h3>La Victoria</h3>

<p>This is the quintessential college eatery. The food here won&#8217;t be great, but
when you&#8217;re starving at 2AM it will be a feast. Their orange salsa is also raved
about but I don&#8217;t think much of it. I tend to avoid
<a href="http://g.co/maps/jez57">La Vic</a> because the food is only &#8220;vegetarian&#8221; if you&#8217;re
willing to apply large double quotes to the term.  It made the list because
you&#8217;ve not properly been to Downtown San José until you&#8217;ve been to La Victoria.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Sightreading is an essential skill for any musician. Turns out it&#8217;s pretty
important for good software developers as well.</em></p>

<h2>What is Sightreading?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been listening to a ton of <a href="http://rubyrogues.com">Ruby Rogues</a>, so let&#8217;s begin with a
definition.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia,</p>

<blockquote><p> <strong>Sightreading</strong> <em>is the reading and performing of a piece of written music,
specifically when the performer has not seen it before.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Musicians are always evaluated on their ability to read and interpret musical
scores on command, a musician&#8217;s time isn&#8217;t cheap and rehearsing a specific piece
of music is a privilege reserved often reserved for school ensembles and AAA
film score recordings. I exaggerate a little, but honestly, professional
musicians are not afforded a lot of rehearsal time. They are instead expected to
walk up to a piece, play their bit expressively while fitting in with the rest
of the ensemble perfectly, sometimes without ever hearing them.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how on Earth this could possibly relate to software, look no
further than your first day on your current project. Most software developers
don&#8217;t have the privilege of starting from scratch when they begin a new job or
contract.  Instead we are thrown into an existing one and expected to decrease
the bug count. Some people might say that&#8217;s an unfair expectation, but it is, in
fact, no different from expecting a professional musician to walk into the
studio, read your score, play their piece once or twice, then collect their
check and leave.</p>

<p>Western music has a complex but accepted system of notation that all musicians
and composers are expected to be familiar with. On top of this base language
there are sets of idioms particular to certain genres. By writing works in this
language and leveraging (often subconsciously) these idioms composers create
music that musicians can read and follow and interpret even <em>as</em> they play.</p>

<p>In the case of software development, the language and idioms are still present,
but they are the languages and idioms of computer programs rather than those of
western music.</p>

<h2>Sightreading Code</h2>

<p>So what&#8217;s the point of sightreading code? Here&#8217;s three scenarios from every
stage of one&#8217;s career.</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re fresh out of University and in a technical interview. You&#8217;ve been
  asked to find and fix the two known bugs in a text formatting program.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ve just started your first day at a new job and you&#8217;ve been tasked with
  extending an existing project with new features.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re a super celebrity master contractor and people pay you way too much
  money. You walk up to code you&#8217;ve never seen before and need to make magic
  happen in order to justify your absurd cost.</li>
</ol>


<p>In each case your value hinges on picking up a brand new codebase and running
with it. Since you can&#8217;t control the quality of code you didn&#8217;t write you can&#8217;t
make any excuses regarding what&#8217;s already written. At this point you have two
options. Skim the code, or read it all.</p>

<p>I will tell you right now, <strong>skimming doesn&#8217;t work.</strong> You can&#8217;t read every other
line or seek for specific variable names and actually follow what is going on.
When you do so, you screw it up.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: Slight boorishness follows</em></p>

<blockquote><p>If you ask me a question about my code, I&#8217;m going to assume you&#8217;ve read every
relevant line.</p></blockquote>

<p>Relevant lines are tough to pin down, but at the very least the entire method in
question is a good start. When you haven&#8217;t done so, it&#8217;s plain disrespectful and
arrogant on your part, especially when your question is answered (or nullified)
by something directly in that body of code. By skimming and then bringing up
something you saw during the skim, you waste your time and mine.</p>

<p>Everyone who has taught me up until a year ago will roll their eyes at me for
this because I was the best at skimming (meaning I was the worst reader/pupil) I
actively avoid jumping to conclusions about what I read and take a concerted
effort to answer as much as I can on my own before escalating a problem.
Furthermore, when I do I often have a much better handle on what question I am
asking than I would otherwise have had.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, when you do this I start to think about spending less time
with you. I warn everyone I&#8217;m comfortable warning not to skim <strong><em>ever</em></strong>.
Including you, dear reader.</p>

<p>Since skimming code doesn&#8217;t work, our only remaining option is to actually read
the code completely. This probably sounds like a lot of work, that&#8217;s because it
is, but so is reading and performing an entire ten minute piece in half an hour
and musicians still manage to get it done.</p>

<p>In order to determine how we can become more effective code sightreaders, we
again look to our musician friends who have been doing this for some time.
Musicians who want to improve their sightreading do the following things.</p>

<h3>Musicians Know and Practice Scales</h3>

<p>Musicians who practice their scales are the ones with the best technical chops,
their fingers are the most agile, their articulation superb and they&#8217;re
comfortable with any given set of notes.</p>

<p>For programmers who wish to improve sightreading, there&#8217;s simple no replacement
for knowing the language you&#8217;re in. If you&#8217;ve never looked at C before, you&#8217;ll
spend 20 minutes figuring out what <code>int main() {</code> is, or spend that time
figuring out the precise semantics of a line ending conditional in Ruby.</p>

<p><em>If you don&#8217;t know the language, you&#8217;ll spend time figuring out what the
language is doing instead of what the program is doing. Know your language.</em></p>

<h3>Musicians Study Music Theory</h3>

<p>Every musician who works with written music needs at least a basic understanding
of music theory. Without it, reading music, let alone interpretting it, is
impossible. Over time many musicians gain an intuitive understanding of theory.
They realize all major scales are the same but starting from a different note,
then slowly absorb more as they go. But some of the best musicians actively
learn theory as theory and can leverage that to do amazing things as Jazz
improvisers, composers, and virtuosos.</p>

<p>As computer scientists, we need to know the design patterns used in our field.
Decorators, strategies, delegation, they all need to be second nature if we
intend to approach a new body of code and immediately see what&#8217;s going on.
Additionally, these patterns establish a common vocabulary you can use to
discuss code with other programmers regardless of their language and experience.
If you both know the patterns, they can add precision and expressiveness to your
non-executable communication.</p>

<p><em>Knowing patterns allows you to see and apply them instantly when you enter a
new codebase or team. Use them as a common vocabulary.</em></p>

<h3>Musicians Sightread During Practice</h3>

<p>Lastly, and hopefully most obviously, musicians practice the act of sightreading
during their own self-directed practice. My high school band director, once said
to our ensemble that if you do something for the first time during the show,
you&#8217;re practicing in front of a live audience, not performing.</p>

<p>Likewise, don&#8217;t assume that if you know your languange and some patterns you&#8217;ll
be an extraordinary sightreader. You need to apply that knowledge frequently if
you want to temper it into skill. Trust me, you do <em>not</em> want to do it on the
job your first few times. If you do, you&#8217;ll likely feel rushed and sink back
into skimming. So find an open source library you use, pop into it&#8217;s source code
and get reading.</p>

<p><em>Don&#8217;t do your practicing in front of a live audience. Read open source code in
order to get better at sightreading.</em></p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Thus far I&#8217;ve made the assumption that you will have no control over the
codebases that you sightread. While this is often the case when starting out,
we often spend a significant amount of time with one codebase and start to grow
into and learn it. While this certainly helps, one of the main differences
between musical scores and software projects is that individual scores seldom
change between performances whereas software is in constant flux. If you wrote
it a week ago you&#8217;ll be sightreading it again next week. If you wrote it a month
ago, how many hands have been at it since you last looked at it? Sightreading is
a constant and ongoing process in software.</p>

<p>As a writer of software, you can and should take steps to make your software
more sightreadable but I&#8217;ve throw a big wall of text at everyone so I think
I&#8217;ll tackle that subject at a later date.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>So <em>who am I now?</em></h2>

<p>Basically I am not anybody. I&#8217;m a student of Computer Science
and Mathematics at San José State University. I have been fiddling with
computers my whole life but would say that the decision to embrace quality
software design only happened about a year and a half ago. My entire formal
education save for one functional programming class which I only had last semester
has been Java but for a token course each in C, C++, and Assembly taught by a
professor who had to mentally translate everything into Java and then translate
it back to answer questions. As a result, I&#8217;m really behind in a lot of stuff I
shouldn&#8217;t be behind in.</p>

<p>In the past two years I&#8217;ve found myself making money doing things in Ruby.
The best thing about Ruby is that it&#8217;s fun to do things right, compared to Java
where you are actively punished for trying to do so. I have made it my business
to be a good Rubyist and live up to <a href="/blog/2011/08/19/why-ruby-needs-heroes">those who inspired me</a> to learn the
language and participate in the community. As part of this process I&#8217;ve read
voraciously on Ruby and software craftmanship, lurked in IRC, and made a
nuisance of myself at conferences and Ruby meetups. The process has made me a
lot of new friends, at times both inflated and deflated my ego, and overall
given me a much grander perspective on what the important things are in life and
in software development.</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s rather difficult to code in 90 minute spats with shoddy internet,
the great majority (read: all but school related) of my projects are in-progress
and incomplete. I <em>despise</em> this about myself. One of the main things I still
suck at is cranking out a project in a weekend. And since most of my projects
are started to apply a specific bit of knowledge or insight, or leverage a
specific language or language feature I wish to do more with, I tend to start
a new one more often than continue work on the old ones. While I don&#8217;t think it
too much of a problem, it&#8217;d definitely feel better to have one or two completed
works in my portfolio that <em>aren&#8217;t</em> a top-down recursive descent parser, of
which I have three with a fourth (Clojure, this time) in progress.</p>

<h2>Just <em>where is he going with this..?</em></h2>

<p>Well now, I&#8217;m working as a Ruby developer, I&#8217;ve finally made it to a Railsbridge
workshop and absolutely love teaching there. More to the credit of Steve&#8217;s open
commit policy than to my own artistry I am a contributor to <a href="http://hackety-hack.com">Hackety-Hack.com</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just decided to apply to January&#8217;s Ruby Mendicant University session though
the upcoming weeks are going to be maddeningly busy for me and I may have to
hold off until the next one comes around. I had the pleasure of taking Peter
Cooper&#8217;s Ruby Reloaded course which I highly recommend for those who learned
just enough Ruby to be potent with Rails but still aren&#8217;t sure what&#8217;s going on
in some cases.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve picked up Clojure and and revisited Haskell and am loving both. I&#8217;ve got a
few ideas in mind for beginning Clojure projects and am preparing for a return
to Archlinux as my primary OS as I simply can&#8217;t tolerate OS X any longer.</p>

<p>I want to start being the type of programmer that inspired me to get as far as
I&#8217;ve had the privilege of getting thus far and I&#8217;ll do it one application,
library, and blog article at a time. Starting&#8230;</p>

<p><strong><em>now.</em></strong></p>
