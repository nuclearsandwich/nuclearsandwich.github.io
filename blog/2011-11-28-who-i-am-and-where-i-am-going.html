  <h2>So <em>who am I now?</em></h2>

<p>Basically I am not anybody. I&#39;m a student of Computer Science
and Mathematics at San José State University. I have been fiddling with
computers my whole life but would say that the decision to embrace quality
software design only happened about a year and a half ago. My entire formal
education save for one functional programming class which I only had last semester
has been Java but for a token course each in C, C++, and Assembly taught by a
professor who had to mentally translate everything into Java and then translate
it back to answer questions. As a result, I&#39;m really behind in a lot of stuff I
shouldn&#39;t be behind in.</p>

<p>In the past two years I&#39;ve found myself making money doing things in Ruby.
The best thing about Ruby is that it&#39;s fun to do things right, compared to Java
where you are actively punished for trying to do so. I have made it my business
to be a good Rubyist and live up to <a href="/blog/2011/08/19/why-ruby-needs-heroes">those who inspired me</a> to learn the
language and participate in the community. As part of this process I&#39;ve read
voraciously on Ruby and software craftmanship, lurked in IRC, and made a
nuisance of myself at conferences and Ruby meetups. The process has made me a
lot of new friends, at times both inflated and deflated my ego, and overall
given me a much grander perspective on what the important things are in life and
in software development.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s rather difficult to code in 90 minute spats with shoddy internet,
the great majority (read: all but school related) of my projects are in-progress
and incomplete. I <em>despise</em> this about myself. One of the main things I still
suck at is cranking out a project in a weekend. And since most of my projects
are started to apply a specific bit of knowledge or insight, or leverage a
specific language or language feature I wish to do more with, I tend to start
a new one more often than continue work on the old ones. While I don&#39;t think it
too much of a problem, it&#39;d definitely feel better to have one or two completed
works in my portfolio that <em>aren&#39;t</em> a top-down recursive descent parser, of
which I have three with a fourth (Clojure, this time) in progress.</p>

<h2>Just <em>where is he going with this..?</em></h2>

<p>Well now, I&#39;m working as a Ruby developer, I&#39;ve finally made it to a Railsbridge
workshop and absolutely love teaching there. More to the credit of Steve&#39;s open
commit policy than to my own artistry I am a contributor to <a href="http://hackety-hack.com">Hackety-Hack.com</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve just decided to apply to January&#39;s Ruby Mendicant University session though
the upcoming weeks are going to be maddeningly busy for me and I may have to
hold off until the next one comes around. I had the pleasure of taking Peter
Cooper&#39;s Ruby Reloaded course which I highly recommend for those who learned
just enough Ruby to be potent with Rails but still aren&#39;t sure what&#39;s going on
in some cases.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve picked up Clojure and and revisited Haskell and am loving both. I&#39;ve got a
few ideas in mind for beginning Clojure projects and am preparing for a return
to Archlinux as my primary OS as I simply can&#39;t tolerate OS X any longer.</p>

<p>I want to start being the type of programmer that inspired me to get as far as
I&#39;ve had the privilege of getting thus far and I&#39;ll do it one application,
library, and blog article at a time. Starting...</p>

<p><strong><em>now.</em></strong></p>
