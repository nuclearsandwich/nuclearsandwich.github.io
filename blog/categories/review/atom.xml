wasting time sleeping then this is for you.</em></p>

<h2>Sleephacking</h2>

<p>I'm a hacker, and as you might surmise, there are a few stereotypes and
connotations associated with that word. The first being that I spend my nights
in front of a computer subverting corrupt governments and stealing half pennies
at a time from banks that will never miss them. While the latter half of this is
false, I do spend many nights, such as the full six it took to write this blog
post over the last three months, in front of a computer screen. The other half,
which you may be less aware of, is that hackers are notorious for refusing to
cave to the pressures of the outside, be it peer pressure, financial pressure,
or otherwise. When someone tells a hacker something is impossible, chances are
all you did was challenge them to make it so. As a result, any time someone in
my life tells me I need to sleep more often, I'm driven to improve my ability to
function on an absolute minimum of sleep necessary to sustain full cognitive
function and bodily health.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, I use a number of tools and tricks, the latest of
which is the [WakeMate][WM] from Y-Combinator company Perfect Third Labs. This
review has been a long time coming and not everything about my experience with
the WakeMate has been ponies and teddy bears, but enough of it has that I can't
say I'd enjoy returning to life before I was using it regularly.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to mention before we dive straight in, is that I am not in
any way affiliated with WakeMate with the exception of working for another YC
company, loving their product, and being on the mailing list for their nightly
and beta Android clients.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let's dive right in...</p>

<h2>What Does it Do</h2>

<p>WakeMate's device sits on your wrist at night and monitors your activity during
sleep. It breaks sleep down into awake, light, average, and deep sleep. It can
tell roughly when you're awake, sleeping lightly, or deeply with pretty good
anecdotal accuracy. By that I mean, any night when I've gotten up at four to
peel the cat off my face and chuck her out has registered on the device.</p>

<p>I've never caught it in an outright lie, so I assume that the data it collects
is at least accurate enough for my purposes.</p>

<p>In addition to collecting all this data, the WakeMate will also act as a smart
alarm. If you tell it by when you need to be awake, it will do its best to wake
you up at the optimal time in your sleep cycle up to twenty minutes before the
time you gave. This is the killer feature. The idea that the alarm should get
you up as early as you need to be, but not on time. People are often harmed by
the snooze button as it drags out long periods of dozing in the morning which in
my experience, serve only to leave me feeling rushed rather than refreshed.
WakeMate in an ideal world eliminates the need for both the snooze button as
well as the true alarm clock.</p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed about the WakeMate was its selection of alarm
tones. Normally when picking an alarm tone, I go with the most jarring, teeth
grinding, horrid noise I can find in the selection. I do this because I needed
to be properly motivated to turn the thing off and not just let it play.
However, the problem with this practice is that when you're woken up by the
sound of a truckload of pots and pans being dropped out a third story window,
you wake up in a jarred and horrid mood. But the WakeMate's selection of tones
doesn't have any jarring alarms, nor does it allow you to specify your own. This
was clearly done on purpose since part of the product's goal is to wake you up
as gently as possible. The WakeMate's alarm tones (all named for colors) all
begin in a soft pianissimo and gently crescendo to at most a mezzoforte. The
effect of which is more akin to being woken by a lover whispering in your ear
and not your younger brother hitting you with his shoes to let you know it's
time to get up for school.</p>

<p>The whole product is designed to make you feel good when you wake up and
that is an mission which they have largely accomplished.</p>

<p>Another component of the WakeMate is the Wakelytics site which helps you
track a your personal sleep score over time as well as give you the ability to
tag any night with specific comments. I've used everything from <code>coffee-10pm</code> to
<code>couch</code> though I've not actually looked much at what it does for me. That said,
if you like game mechanics, leaderboards, and sleeping. WakeMate's top sleepers
board might be the place for you to bathe in the limelight.</p>

<h2>What doesn't it do</h2>

<p>This is both tricky and simple. Firstly, the WakeMate isn't a magic solution
that you wear on your wrist in order to ward off oversleep demons. If you're
that tired, you'll just sleep through it like any other alarm. It also
isn't the best at preserving your data on Android, there have been a number of
nights where I lost data due to bluetooth bugs, application crashes,
accidentally running the device battery out, and so on. While the betas have
been getting better and better about this, it'd still be nice to have a fallback
such as not deleting data on power cycle but instead having a dedicated (and
somewhat hard to push) reset button. Beyond that, there isn't much advertised
that it doesn't deliver. At this point I think they're on the right path and
just need to step up on the user experience side</p>

<h2>What I'd like to see</h2>

<p>The main feature that WakeMate lacks for my desired use case is something I'm
going to call a Powernap Button (Feel free to use this if you like fellows.)
Which will let me sleep for a single light -&gt; medium -&gt; heavy -&gt;
medium -&gt; light sleep cycle and then wake me up. Especially on nights which
would otherwise have to be all nighters, this would be massively awesome.</p>

<p>Another awesome feature would be an API to access live WakeMate data
about my current sleep. It'd be great to wire up the electric kettle to start
heating up once I've entered light sleeping and will soon be woken up and a
million other neat tricks like  beyond that all they really need is a bit of
user side polish and the willingness of people to try new things in order to
free themselves of the snooze button.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The WakeMate is a great tool if you want to tweak your sleeping habits and get
more out of less sleep. I haven't yet taken full advantage of all it has to
offer and the Android client is a little haphazard but constantly getting
better. I'd love to be able to hit a website with a request and get back some
json data of about my current sleep status. That would be fun to play with.</p>

<h2>Comments from the Posterous Version</h2>

<h3>Jon Schwartz</h3>

<blockquote><p>I've been using the wakemate for a little while now too (I think I was in
the second shipment). I have also found the wrist band to be too tight, so I
turned it inside out as some people suggested on the WM Blog, that solved the
issue. However, it caused another side issue. Now, the wrist band turns off in
the middle of the night (switch gets flipped) and I get woken up at the end
time instead of the correct time.</p>

<p>The software has gotten much better since version 1 (on Droid 1) and my data
hasn't been lost lost in quite a while. Sometimes, I'll have to power cycle
the wrist band, but it doesn't lose my data.</p>

<p>I agree, their interface on Android needs a little more spit and polish and I,
too, would love api access. I doubt, however, they could offer us real time
access as I think the wrist band goes into low power mode when it doesn't
detect movement and its not close to wake up time.</p>

<p>There was also that whole situation with the exploding usb charger. I haven't
gotten a replacement, have you?</p>

<p>Overall, I agree with your assessment. The wakemate is a great tool, but I
still haven't shut off my backup alarm.</p></blockquote>

<h3>K|O|G|I</h3>

<blockquote><p>I've been using the wakemate for almost a month now. I didn't get a charger
with my shipment at all. When I emailed them about it, they said they had
issues with them, and are no longer including them <em>at all</em> -- they told me
to check Amazon.com and buy one for myself.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Steven! Ragnarök</h3>

<blockquote><p>@Jon, I haven't gotten a replacement either, but USB wall warts are a dime a
dozen in my household, so I hadn't even been using it when they sent out the
recall. There's lots of little things with the Android app, like not entering
portrait mode when I crack open the keyboard to type in my login info. Nothing
that makes it unusable in my opinion, but not pleasant by half. Especially not
when you're already half asleep.</p>

<p>@KOGI it's a shame they sent you out to Amazon, they should at least recognize
one that they accept. So many of the adapters I've found on Amazon have
shorted out themselves!</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments guys.</p></blockquote>

<h3>hjwieland</h3>

<blockquote><p>Hy, thanks for your great review! Based on it I have bought a WakeMate, too.
I'm an Android user so it would be great to test the nightly Android client
builds. But I dont find the mailng list of WakeMate you mentioned? Would be
great if you can point me to it. Thanks in advance!</p></blockquote>

<h3>Steven! Ragnarök</h3>

<blockquote><p>@hjwieland it might just take them a while, They currently have one developer
doing all the work for both Android and Blackberry platforms. If you're
desperately impatient, post your email to @__nil on Twitter as he's the fine
fellow running the show. That seems to be the way the last few guys got in.
Remember that beta means beta which means occasional loss of data. If you
value the stats maybe you should stick with the Market versions. I'm not
fussed about the stats, which is why I volunteered to test.</p></blockquote>

<h3>bev</h3>

<blockquote><p>Excellent post, I have found sleep success with the wakemate and have shaved
off about an hour a night without as much as a yawn.</p>

<p>You're "What I’d like to see" rocks. I now want things to come alive just I am
waking up.</p>
