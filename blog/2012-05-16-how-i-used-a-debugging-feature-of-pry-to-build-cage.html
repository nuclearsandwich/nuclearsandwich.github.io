    <h1>How I Used a "Debugging Feature" of Pry to Build Cage</h1>
    <h2>published: 16 May 2012 21:05:00PM</h2>
  </header>
  <p><a href="http://pry.github.com">Pry</a> is an alternative interactive Ruby environment
similar to IRB. In addition to looking a little nicer through nearly live
colorization, Pry offers some pretty powerful features for exploring, modifying,
and debugging Ruby applications in a live system.</p>

<p>Pry&#39;s namesake ability to &quot;pry&quot; open an object is not limited to debugging use.
It&#39;s actually a really straightforward way to build any kind of domain specific
REPL. I think I just coined that term but it fits well and you&#39;ll soon see why.</p>

<h2>The Backstory</h2>

<p>When I working at <a href="http://nowbox.com">NOWBOX</a> I spent a lot of time hitting our
API during ad-hoc testing. I was doing enough of this that just using curl
wasn&#39;t cutting it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, curl is awesome and super useful. But it lacks a few
niceties. Chief among them curl, like HTTP, is stateless without the use of
cookie files and given that we were using a token-based authentication system,
simulating device-API interaction using exclusively curl was neither fun nor
easy.</p>

<p>During this time, we were also using
<a href="https://github.com/brynary/rack-test">Rack::Test</a>, which I really like. It&#39;s a
solid and purposeful DSL and great at what it does. What it isn&#39;t good at is
being interactive. I&#39;d get colourful explosions(stacktraces) whenever I tried to
pry into and look at a test using <code>Rack::Test</code>.</p>

<p>We already had the awesome <a href="https://github.com/technoweenie/faraday">Faraday</a>
included in our project, so I hacked together a quick rake task that would set
up a <code>Faraday::Connection</code> and pry into it. What did this get me? I now had my
interactive <code>Rack::Test</code>.</p>

<h3>Cage Version -1</h3>

<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h2>Building the Gem</h2>

<p>Pry made this really easy. So easy that later on, when I wanted to rewrite the
above code and turn it into a reusable gem I kept the same strategy.</p>

<p>I build my DSL class, <code>Cage::Console</code>, which also handles all the initialization
such as config file loading and default values for variables. It also overloads
some of Pry&#39;s settings to get a more interesting prompt string and suppressing
they default <code>~/.pryrc</code> config file loading.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># lib/cage/console.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cage</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Console</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span> <span class="n">config_file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
    <span class="n">configure_pry</span>
    <span class="n">read_config_file</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">expand_path</span> <span class="n">config_file</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">config_file</span>
    <span class="n">default_to_rubygems</span>
    <span class="n">reinitialize_connection</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="c1">## The rest of the show</span>
  <span class="c1">## ...</span>
  <span class="c1">## The party starter</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">start!</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span>
    <span class="kp">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pry</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The rest of the class is the domain specific stuff that deals with delegating to
the Faraday connection object and building the response object. I built my own
wrapper around Faraday&#39;s response so I could improve how they are displayed as
return values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># lib/cage/response.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cage</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Response</span>
  <span class="c1">## Delegating code</span>
  <span class="c1">## ...</span>
  <span class="c1">## Prettification code</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">inspect</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;&lt;-</span><span class="no">PRETTY</span>
<span class="sh">Status: #{status}</span>

<span class="sh">Headers:</span>
<span class="sh">#{headers.map { |k, v| &quot;  #{k}: #{v}&quot; }.join &quot;\n&quot;}</span>

<span class="sh">Body:</span>
<span class="sh">  #{body}</span>

<span class="sh">#&lt;Cage::Response:(#{url})&gt;</span>
<span class="no">      PRETTY</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>It&#39;s certainly verbose but the primary function is to show you the complete
result of an HTTP request, which it does.</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>

<p>That&#39;s  basically all there is to it. This feature of Pry that&#39;s mainly
advertised as a way to get hands-on with your objects for debugging is also a
great way to build a domain specific or domain focused interactive environment.
Depending on how much you want to customize Pry&#39;s interface you don&#39;t even need
a thorough understanding of Pry&#39;s internals. If you&#39;re more interested in the
features <em>of</em> Cage than the mechanics of its construction you can install it
from RubyGems using <code>gem install cage</code> or check out its <a href="/cage">project page</a>.
The complete source for Cage is on
<a href="https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/cage">GitHub</a>. I hope you use Pry and Cage
to build awesome stuff!</p>
