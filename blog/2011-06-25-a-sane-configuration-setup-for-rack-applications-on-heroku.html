    <h1>A Sane Configuration Setup for Rack Applications on Heroku</h1>
    <h2>published: 25 Jun 2011 12:06:00PM</h2>
  </header>
  <h2>Update 29, June 2012</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been a whole year and a bit since I first published this and it&#39;s still
pretty much how I handle rack applications on Heroku. We did run into one
problem which I regretfully forgot to report back at the time.  Numbers. In
Yaml, numbers are actually numbers. In the environment, everything is a string.
We didn&#39;t realize this until a couple months later when we introduced a limit
constant.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="vg">MAX_VIDEOS_IN_TRENDING</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="il">100</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In our local yml file everything is peaches and gravy. Well as you can imagine
we deploy to staging and suddenly everything is borrken. </p>

<h3>The Error:</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ArgumentError</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">comparison</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">Fixnum</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">failed</span>

<h3>The Fix:</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># config/setup.rb</span>

<p>Rather horrid isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t know of a better way, aside from hard-coding the
names of your settings which are meant to be numeric. If you have floating point
values you can make a similar pass for floats. This was originally suggested by
<a href="https://twitter.com/dapunster">@dapunster</a>.</p>

<h3>New Alternatives</h3>

<p>Since writing this, I&#39;ve seen two alternatives to my setup which both take the
opposite approach and make it easier to set environment variables in test and
development. The first and one I&#39;d most like to try is the
<a href="https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv">direnv</a> project. It adds a function to your
bashrc/zshrc that checks for a <code>.envrc</code> file and runs it.</p>

<p>The second approach which applies when you&#39;re using <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a> is to
abuse (yes, it is an abuse) your <code>.rvmrc</code>, which is just a sourced shell script,
to add any project specific environment variables. I really hate this approach
but it does work.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve updated the <a href="https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/saneconf">Git repo</a> with the example code for this setup dropping
ActiveRecord and Resque scheduler in favor of some arbitrary numbered config
values. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please drop me a pull request
or email.</p>

<p><em>Original article below</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> The Github repo I linked at the end of this article was private
and I forgot to make it public. It is now, sorry. ~Steven!</p>

<p>Recently, Nowmov has started using <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for application
deployment. In the past I&#39;ve always been hesitant toward &quot;hosted
solutions&quot; but a combination of focusing my time and the flexibility and
power of Heroku&#39;s Celadon Cedar stack has brought me into contact with
one such solution.</p>

<p>One of the first peculiarities/gotchas/side-effects of many of these
hosted solutions is that they don&#39;t provide shell or ftp access. Nor can
you write to the file system from your application. This caused us some
interesting problems during the migration.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rails convention dictates that <code>config/settings.yml</code>,
<code>config/database.yml</code> and friends not be stored in source control and
that we should store template files instead so developers are aware of
setup specific configuration details. However, our inability to push
files not in source control to Heroku leaves us unable to use the
standard convention for configuration details. The way Heroku bypasses
this leads to the next hurdle.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole point of Heroku is that you don&#39;t deal with IT, just your
code. This means that you don&#39;t really care where your PostgreSQL
database is or what port you use to connect to your Redis instance. But
you still need to connect to those things! So what does Heroku do? They
give you environment variables. <code>heroku run &#39;echo $DATABASE_URL&#39;</code>
returns a big long uri corresponding to your app&#39;s database. With this
specific config variable, Heroku is kind enough to render a
<code>database.yml</code> from it using erb. But it only works ActiveRecord
compatible database.ymls, which is not all of them, believe it or not.
(I&#39;m looking at you Sequel) Inspect your Heroku config variables by
running <code>heroku config</code> from an app directory. The amount of scary
looking crap in there might surprise you!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can even add your own config variables such as
<code>MR_FANCY_PANTS=the_worlds_best_pants</code> with
<code>heroku config:add MR_FANCY_PANTS=sad_deep_inside ARTIST=&quot;Jonathan
Coulton&quot;</code> this command will expose both your variables to your code
using Ruby&#39;s <code>ENV</code> hash.</p>

<p>In your code you&#39;d get to it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">#!ruby</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">controller_action</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="no">ENV</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;ARTIST&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Jonathan Coulton&quot;</span>
    <span class="vi">@still_alive</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>But then this also has to work locally! So you need to do somethig like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">#!ruby</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">controller_action</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="no">ENV</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;ARTIST&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="no">SETTINGS</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:artist</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Jonathan Coulton&quot;</span>
    <span class="vi">@still_alive</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you could set up all these environment variables using a
rake or thor task before launching your app but who wants to deal with
that? My favorite solution to a problem is a coding solution.</p>

<p>And you have to do that <em>everywhere</em> you want to use a situation
specific configuration. I don&#39;t know about you but that seems hacky,
error prone, and repetitive to me. Smelly code, in other words. In
working on my recent projects I&#39;ve been studying a large number of small
Ruby applications. Mostly Sinatra but some in Rails and Padrino as well.
In all those apps, I never found a ubiquitously deployed solution for
the configuration situation in a Heroku-style environment so I left it
to simmer a few days and dealt with <code>ENV[:KEY] || SETTINGS[&#39;key&#39;]</code> all
over my app. Then, over too much cold brew coffee I came up with a
workable solution. While this is the very first time I&#39;ve seen this
solution in a web application. It actually comes from messing around in
<code>irb</code> earlier in the week trying to alter prompt strings for vanity&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>Everyone open <code>irb</code> right now! Just go to a terminal and do it! Got it? Okay</p>

<p><code>&gt; IRB.conf</code></p>

<p>You&#39;ll see how this inspired my solution later on. Or perhaps I&#39;m not as
brilliant as I think I am and it&#39;s obvious to you already (<em>likely</em>).</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say we&#39;re working on a lightweight Sinatra application and we
know that it&#39;ll start simple and grow in complexity later on. Since
we&#39;re smart we&#39;re going to namespace the whole thing under a module.
Namely <code>Saneconf</code> Our skeleton looks like this:</p>

<p>All this does is check for the existence of a <code>settings.yml</code> and load  it&#39;s
values into our (currently) empty configuration hash using an  in-place
<code>#merge!</code>. The reason we do this is because we very  purposefully didn&#39;t supply
a mutator <code>Saneconf.conf=</code> for our config  hash. We don&#39;t <em>want</em> it to be
overwritten later on. For the moment  though we can change existing keys and add
new ones. Next we handle all  non-scalar configuration by parsing some of the
scalar ones into hashes.  Arrays or any other Ruby object could be placed in the
<code>conf</code> hash. It  just happens that Hashes are commonly used by libraries like
ActiveRecord and the Ruby Redis interface for initialization. The reason  I
expand those here and not in place at point-of-use is mostly personal
preference. All I ever want to see in the app is <code>conf[&#39;VARIABLE&#39;]</code> and  I
shouldn&#39;t have to think about it and whatever I&#39;m trying to accomplish  at that
point in our app. Lastly, we call <code>#freeze</code> on the conf hash.  This is a method
every Ruby object has which makes it immutable,  throwing an exception if an
attempt is made to change it. This way, any  of your fellow developers will know
that whatever they&#39;re doing belongs  in your application initialization code and
not in the middle of your  important code.   Hopefully this proves helpful, the
example code is available on
