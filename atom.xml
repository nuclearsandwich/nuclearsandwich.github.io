    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. It is the first post with the new blogging engine &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;
I was having a lot of trouble with Posterous's post by email and their
antiquated markdown version. So here I am, on this shiny new, happily Vim-able
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wakemate: A Review After Three Months</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: The WakeMate is great, if you like waking up feeling rested or hate
wasting time sleeping then this is for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sleephacking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a hacker, and as you might surmise, there are a few stereotypes and
connotations associated with that word. The first being that I spend my nights
in front of a computer subverting corrupt governments and stealing half pennies
at a time from banks that will never miss them. While the latter half of this is
false, I do spend many nights, such as the full six it took to write this blog
post over the last three months, in front of a computer screen. The other half,
which you may be less aware of, is that hackers are notorious for refusing to
cave to the pressures of the outside, be it peer pressure, financial pressure,
or otherwise. When someone tells a hacker something is impossible, chances are
all you did was challenge them to make it so. As a result, any time someone in
my life tells me I need to sleep more often, I'm driven to improve my ability to
function on an absolute minimum of sleep necessary to sustain full cognitive
function and bodily health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accomplish this, I use a number of tools and tricks, the latest of
which is the [WakeMate][WM] from Y-Combinator company Perfect Third Labs. This
review has been a long time coming and not everything about my experience with
the WakeMate has been ponies and teddy bears, but enough of it has that I can't
say I'd enjoy returning to life before I was using it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to mention before we dive straight in, is that I am not in
any way affiliated with WakeMate with the exception of working for another YC
company, loving their product, and being on the mailing list for their nightly
and beta Android clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let's dive right in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Does it Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WakeMate's device sits on your wrist at night and monitors your activity during
sleep. It breaks sleep down into awake, light, average, and deep sleep. It can
tell roughly when you're awake, sleeping lightly, or deeply with pretty good
anecdotal accuracy. By that I mean, any night when I've gotten up at four to
peel the cat off my face and chuck her out has registered on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never caught it in an outright lie, so I assume that the data it collects
is at least accurate enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to collecting all this data, the WakeMate will also act as a smart
alarm. If you tell it by when you need to be awake, it will do its best to wake
you up at the optimal time in your sleep cycle up to twenty minutes before the
time you gave. This is the killer feature. The idea that the alarm should get
you up as early as you need to be, but not on time. People are often harmed by
the snooze button as it drags out long periods of dozing in the morning which in
my experience, serve only to leave me feeling rushed rather than refreshed.
WakeMate in an ideal world eliminates the need for both the snooze button as
well as the true alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed about the WakeMate was its selection of alarm
tones. Normally when picking an alarm tone, I go with the most jarring, teeth
grinding, horrid noise I can find in the selection. I do this because I needed
to be properly motivated to turn the thing off and not just let it play.
However, the problem with this practice is that when you're woken up by the
sound of a truckload of pots and pans being dropped out a third story window,
you wake up in a jarred and horrid mood. But the WakeMate's selection of tones
doesn't have any jarring alarms, nor does it allow you to specify your own. This
was clearly done on purpose since part of the product's goal is to wake you up
as gently as possible. The WakeMate's alarm tones (all named for colors) all
begin in a soft pianissimo and gently crescendo to at most a mezzoforte. The
effect of which is more akin to being woken by a lover whispering in your ear
and not your younger brother hitting you with his shoes to let you know it's
time to get up for school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole product is designed to make you feel good when you wake up and
that is an mission which they have largely accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of the WakeMate is the Wakelytics site which helps you
track a your personal sleep score over time as well as give you the ability to
tag any night with specific comments. I've used everything from &lt;code&gt;coffee-10pm&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;couch&lt;/code&gt; though I've not actually looked much at what it does for me. That said,
if you like game mechanics, leaderboards, and sleeping. WakeMate's top sleepers
board might be the place for you to bathe in the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What doesn't it do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is both tricky and simple. Firstly, the WakeMate isn't a magic solution
that you wear on your wrist in order to ward off oversleep demons. If you're
that tired, you'll just sleep through it like any other alarm. It also
isn't the best at preserving your data on Android, there have been a number of
nights where I lost data due to bluetooth bugs, application crashes,
accidentally running the device battery out, and so on. While the betas have
been getting better and better about this, it'd still be nice to have a fallback
such as not deleting data on power cycle but instead having a dedicated (and
somewhat hard to push) reset button. Beyond that, there isn't much advertised
that it doesn't deliver. At this point I think they're on the right path and
just need to step up on the user experience side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I'd like to see&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature that WakeMate lacks for my desired use case is something I'm
going to call a Powernap Button (Feel free to use this if you like fellows.)
Which will let me sleep for a single light -&amp;gt; medium -&amp;gt; heavy -&amp;gt;
medium -&amp;gt; light sleep cycle and then wake me up. Especially on nights which
would otherwise have to be all nighters, this would be massively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another awesome feature would be an API to access live WakeMate data
about my current sleep. It'd be great to wire up the electric kettle to start
heating up once I've entered light sleeping and will soon be woken up and a
million other neat tricks like  beyond that all they really need is a bit of
user side polish and the willingness of people to try new things in order to
free themselves of the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WakeMate is a great tool if you want to tweak your sleeping habits and get
more out of less sleep. I haven't yet taken full advantage of all it has to
offer and the Android client is a little haphazard but constantly getting
better. I'd love to be able to hit a website with a request and get back some
json data of about my current sleep status. That would be fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments from the Posterous Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jon Schwartz&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for a little while now too (I think I was in
the second shipment). I have also found the wrist band to be too tight, so I
turned it inside out as some people suggested on the WM Blog, that solved the
issue. However, it caused another side issue. Now, the wrist band turns off in
the middle of the night (switch gets flipped) and I get woken up at the end
time instead of the correct time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software has gotten much better since version 1 (on Droid 1) and my data
hasn't been lost lost in quite a while. Sometimes, I'll have to power cycle
the wrist band, but it doesn't lose my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, their interface on Android needs a little more spit and polish and I,
too, would love api access. I doubt, however, they could offer us real time
access as I think the wrist band goes into low power mode when it doesn't
detect movement and its not close to wake up time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also that whole situation with the exploding usb charger. I haven't
gotten a replacement, have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I agree with your assessment. The wakemate is a great tool, but I
still haven't shut off my backup alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;K|O|G|I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for almost a month now. I didn't get a charger
with my shipment at all. When I emailed them about it, they said they had
issues with them, and are no longer including them &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; -- they told me
to check Amazon.com and buy one for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steven! Ragnar√∂k&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Jon, I haven't gotten a replacement either, but USB wall warts are a dime a
dozen in my household, so I hadn't even been using it when they sent out the
recall. There's lots of little things with the Android app, like not entering
portrait mode when I crack open the keyboard to type in my login info. Nothing
that makes it unusable in my opinion, but not pleasant by half. Especially not
when you're already half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@KOGI it's a shame they sent you out to Amazon, they should at least recognize
one that they accept. So many of the adapters I've found on Amazon have
shorted out themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comments guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Computer Science Education in Silicon Valley</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-22T09:11:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;a.k.a: &lt;em&gt;Dear SJSU pls stop making me memorize the Java API, my degree is in
Comp. Sci. not JDK 1.6 kthxbaiSTFU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would think that being in the heart of Silicon Valley, the very birthplace
of the personal computer, would be a colossal advantage to a student of computer
science and mathematics who is pursuing software development as a career. Sadly,
this is not the case. The curriculum and course materials taught by the two
local community colleges I've attended in the past and the university at which I
am enrolled is frightfully out of date. But not nearly as paleolithic as the
evaluation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two kinds of computer science courses (10 different kinds
for those in the know), implementation classes and theory classes. The bulk of
my criticism here lies in theimplementation classes. When I started taking
programming classes in college, I began with Intro to Programming in Java and
Programming I in C++. My father, a games developer from days of yore took the
courses with me for laughs. In class, there was a computer at every seat, we
took our notes directly in the text editor, ran code that was being written on
the board live and often times had to correct errors in the professor's code
while he was writing it out. However, all our exams were handwritten and thus
there was no way to check our code against the compiler. In intro to programming
this isn't really a big deal, but later down the road in Object Oriented Design
and Patterns, we're being asked to write snippets of complex GUI programs
utilizing &lt;em&gt;__dozens))&lt;/em&gt; of standard library classes and methods. In one course,
the solution for this was a single laptop with the standard Java API
documentation on it that the students could wait in line for &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the exam.
In another, it is allowing each student to have a packet of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; 8.5 x 11 pages
on the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;th test of the semester.In this modern world where APIs are subject to
change and up-to-date documentation on every thing (except Ruby's Net::HTTP,
Oh Snap!) is readily available online, wasting brain-space memorizing API calls
is downright fscking stupid and I refuse to do it. This is another incarnation
of the classic fable &quot;Give a man a fish, he will pass a test. Teach him to RTFM,
he will actually be a software developer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so far had only one class where the exam was to write a program, at a
computer and submit it in an inbox by the end of the class period. This is
absolutely the correct way to do things. The professor told us at the beginning
of the exam that perusing the docs (.Net) online was A-OK but that going
anywhere else would result in an F on the exam. He didn't even really walk
around and check. He had the wisdom to realize that cheaters will cheat and that
the internet can only help so much if you don't know what you're doing. Those
exams were not only more straightforward, fun, and challenging, but also the
most educational I have had within the realm of software development thus far
in the five years I've been a college student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, if you're given the opportunity to teach a batch of computer
scientists, ask yourself if your class is about concepts or coding and if the
latter, write your test to be implemented on the computer in 90 minutes time.
None of their future employers give two shits about whether or not they know
what method to call on JDialog to get the output you want. That can be looked
up. They're looking for confident implementers who can pick up with a new
language or framework in an afternoon and get started right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Try to Be Satisfied With Partial Credit and You Should Too</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-07T11:42:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows about partial credit, partial credit is what happens when you
half-ass that essay, or forget to start that assignment until the morning before
its due. Sometimes, partial credit comes at you completely out of the blue, when
you thought you had the assignment in the bag. If you're professor is really out
to get you, then they will only give &quot;full credit&quot; for &quot;outstanding work&quot;,
whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got partial credit in early elementary school because I picked things up
rather quickly and once I'd gotten the hang of things, I stopped working at them
and went back to Mario or Sonic. I got partial credit in late elementary and
middle school because I didn't understand the value of what I was learning at
the time. I got partial credit in high school because there were far too many
things more fun than doing all the assignments or studying for the tests and
quizzes. I get partial credit in college because I work for a living, and like
it, and try to maintain the shambles that is my personal life. I've never been
the sort to focus on school, but that doesn't mean I don't agonize every time I
get an assignment back with less than perfect. Autograded assignments such as
those for calculus and physics, or most horribly, an online submission for a
computer program, which gives you instant and mercilessly objective feedback.
Well, it's like a drug, like failing to get the high score when the initials
you're trying to beat are those of the jock kid who used the allowance from his
rich parents to woo away your girlfriend. I just keep putting quarters in until
I'm completely tapped. I recently sent an email to one of my professors because
the amount of out-of-class work for their class for one week exceeded the time I
spent sleeping and doing work for all my other classes combined for that week,
which anyone must be forced to admit, is a little absurd. The reply I got was
simply this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;just do the best you can, and call it a day. Everyone is subjected to the
same thing...  You don't need to get every single point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to get every single point. In my estimation, there are two*
primary reasons professors assign as much as they do. Either they firmly believe
that their class is the only one you should be taking that semester and that you
aren't doing anything else or they've completely forgotten the insanity of
undergraduate studies. So you can see that getting such a candid admission that
collecting all the points is not necessary to knowing the material. And indeed,
I had a week previously received the highest grade in the class on the exam.
(45/50, not all the pointseven then.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes two hands to count the number of times I conciously took partial credit
in the last month. Sometimes it was to study harder for another class or
complete an assignment that was weighted more heavily, sometimes it was to wrap
up a project for work, and other times it was just because the coffee was hot,
the conversation good and I didn't want to pull out my books and give up the
conversation. Some nights I just wanted to put in a full night's rest. But I do
it, I try to use it sparingly, but I'm also not going to commit ritual suicide
when that ugly &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; shows up on my transcript at the end of the semester. A
complete stranger might see that and see a student who &quot;didn't apply himself
fully&quot; or some other nonsense. But my girlfriend will see it as the week I spent
visiting her, my employer will see it as the projects I stayed up all night
finishing to be ready the next morning, and my old friend will see it as the
rainy afternoon at the coffee house we spent catching up and ignoring the world.
I'll see it as a representation of the rewards for my effort in balancing the
many aspects of my life and I'll have the knowledge of what I learned to judge
for myself what portion of the education offered I took for myself. I generally
find that I got what I wanted and often much much more. So, the next time you're
faced with a choice between catching up with an old friend, or getting a full
night's sleep for the first time in a month, and getting a passing grade or full
credit on an assignment, just remember: &quot;You don't need to get every single
point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There is a third less common reason that is quite popular with math teachers
and that is that C is defined as average and is therefore where they want most
of their students to fall with a standard bell curve around it and grading
convention be damned... sadists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Initial Commit</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/10/26/initial-commit/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-26T02:27:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/10/26/initial-commit</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I doubt there is anyone actually going to my website. I refuse to employ
silly Google Analytics for a toy site like my own. I'm in the unfortunate
position of being both rubbish at design, and very particular about it. Thus, I
do something with my website that I like at the time, and then can't bring
myself to go back to it because I know I won't like it and end up redoing it
from scratch, but I have all of these things I've been meaning to write down. I
guess I'll do it here. I picked posterous because I can just write myself emails
and they accidentally become public, so I better not talk about the money I've
stashed in the third tree on the left near the playground outside my old
school...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a number of things have happened since I last wrote anything longer than
140 chars on the internet. The whole microblagging thing is one of them. I have
become somewhat enamored of identi.ca, my usage of which increased heavily after
I got a twitter account for my job. Not so much the format, though I do find it
a challenge against my natural verbosity, but the people. People make a social
network and Identi.cats are some of the coolest folk on the great wide online.
Having been inspired by the work and play of my fellow #neckbeards and free
software users, I decided to spend more time contributing back to community. I
think a lot of this will come in the form of documentation, bug reporting, and
baked goods for the locals. Part of this was reconstructing my online presence.
So here I am. I make no promises of regularity, nor about what content will
follow this, if any. But if I become moved to write about something, it will
more than likely manifest itself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, I guess I have a blog now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven!&lt;/p&gt;
