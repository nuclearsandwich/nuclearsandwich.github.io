    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not quite. It is the first post with the new blogging engine &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;
I was having a lot of trouble with Posterous's post by email and their
antiquated markdown version. So here I am, on this shiny new, happily Vim-able
platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy begins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Engine Yard Whisky Dinner, CodeConf 2011</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/27/engine-yard-whisky-dinner-code-conf-2011/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-27T11:19:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/27/engine-yard-whisky-dinner-code-conf-2011</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5/3/11: Scroll to the bottom to see a near comprehensive list of what
we drank. If I missed anything, do let me know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I'd like to thank Engine Yard for knowing that geeks tend to be
inter-disciplinary and enjoy geeky discussion of things other than code! They
also made an excellent choice in inviting Craig because he's clearly one of the
biggest geeks on the planet... in the field of Scotch Whisky. Since the Whisky
dinner was at Engine Yard's office a group from the Convore chat for the
conference decided to meet at and walk from the hotel. I had to run back to the
Nowmov office to grab the rest of my stuff since I was intending to take the
train home directly from dinner. So myself, Steve Klabnik, Tom Preston-Werner
and his wife, and a bunch of other folks from the conference all walked down
over together. About three blocks from the hotel, I found $20. I'm not lying,
nor am I lying when I say that that was without a doubt the worst part of my
evening. The rest was just that awesome. Upon arrival we were told to snag
t-shirts, which were created specially for the evening and parodied GitHub's
&quot;Fork You&quot; shirts, which you can customize with your GitHub handle by placing
your name on the back in the blank after http://github.com/________, in case you
haven't seen them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After snagging a shirt, we were directed toward the &quot;soft drinks&quot; which
consisted of Guinness, Stella Artois, and Lagunitas IPA. It was hard not to
notice the sea of clear plastic cups all around us, each filled with a small
measure of brown liquid. I had a beer or two over good conversation while Craig
and Randall were finishing up. I have to admin, I was a little anxious to get
started as I noticed that on the last table was a bottle marked Lagavulin, which
is a distillery which comes highly recommended by @vanden and @mcnalu on
Identi.ca, but which I haven't been able to try yet. Add to that, the fact that
it is getting on toward 8:25 and the last train home for the night departs at
9:15 and is a ten minute walk away. Things finally start up and Randall
introduces Craig, who is very tall and has been wandering around enigmatically
the whole time. After a brief introduction by Randall, Craig tells us a little
about his history and current job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only difference between myself and an alcoholic is I get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He launches into the official definition of Scotch Malt Whisky which is any
spirit which meets the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is made using malted barley from Scotland exclusively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is distilled in Scotland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is aged in oak barrels for a minimum of three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's it, that's all that you need! Once everyone is on the same page, he
introduces us to the first whisky of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Johnnie Walker Black Label&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Johnnie Walker, he explains, is significant because it sells. And provides
jobs for a vast number of people relative to the other distilleries. Economic
reasoning aside. We also discuss the very quick finish of the Johnnie Walker
which attempts to make up for some of the sweetness, whilst simultaneously
letting you get another glass without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenfiddich 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the night, Craig's explanations of the different whiskies was both
narrative and informative. Even if you didn't care a hoot about the history of
Scotch whisky, he carried you forward with the story of it. I certainly saw more
faces in rapt attention than lost in smartphones. The Glenfiddich itself was as
smooth as I remember it being when I sampled some at Christmas, it lacked the
complexity of some of the ones we had later that night but I'll definitely
consider it as a potential light whisky, or breakfast whisky, as Craig called
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aberlour 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aberlour was the first of these that really got my attention, it was complex
yet smooth and had a much stronger oaky aroma than the others. Not much was said
about the Aberlour distillery itself though the transition topic between the
Aberlour and the Macallan discussed the difference between Scotches from the
Highlands, Speyside, and Islay. The gist of which was that they have
historically produced whiskies with certain characteristics but that the region
is no surefire indication of the actual product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Macallan 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the Macallan to be a little underwhelming, considering it's such a high
profile Scotch. It certainly wasn't bad, mind you, but it's priced much higher
than Glenfiddich and has a very similar flavor profile. Though, I may have to
revisit it as I drank it rather hurriedly in order to get to the first of the
peated Islay whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Caol Ila 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, just, wow. This was the stand-out Scotch of the evening for me.
Tremendously oak aroma which was also present, though subtler, in the taste.
The Caol Ila did not taste as peated as the Lagavulin or many of the whiskies
later enjoyed in the smoking room but it really made up for it with the great
oak flavor. I'm just raving at this point so I'll say no more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lagavulin 16 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Lavagulin we were treated to a brief and somewhat premature
announcement regarding the Fandabbydozy and the difficulty getting it into the
country, but more on that later. The Lagavulin has been recommended to me by
@vanden for some time. Basically since I asked the internet for Scotch
recommendations. Sadly I was never able to locate any. But Craig provided I
actually recall feeling a little underwhelmed by it, but I expect that's because
I was so keen on the Caol Ila. This is another one I want to try again a little
earlier in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-Smoking Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Lagavulin we were released into the wild to to visit the three rooms
which had been mysteriously marked Smoking Room, Non-Smoking Room, and Exam Room
since our arrival. Those who were familiar with certain properties of Scotch
like myself probably guessed at the difference between the two rooms and were
correct. The Non-Smoking room held the unpeated whiskies. In here I tried things
like the Macallan Cask Strength and the Clynelish 14 year, which was my favorite
of the non-smoking room. There was a third bottle in here but I can't recall
what it was as there was no room for it on the back of my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smoking Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the room for me I knew it'd be awesome, what I didn't know was just how
awesome it would be. My notes rapidly begin to decline in quality in this room.
So I know the scotches were excellent. In here was an Ardbeg 12 Year, the
Laphroaig Murray McDavid, and again, a third which I cannot recall because I ran
out of room on the shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exam Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he introduced the other two rooms, Randall also introduced the exam room.
In this room there were a number of cups containing an unnamed spirit. Our goal
was to try some and identify in as much detail as we could, using the techniques
we learned from Craig, the spirit in the cups. Everyone would pitch their card
with their guess written on it into the pile and the winner would get a bottle
of something wonderful to bring home. I was one of the last people in the room
and submitted my scrawled flavor notes just as they were getting ready to pick
the winner. What I wrote follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardamom, floral, juniper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost like a genever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no peat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% - 55% a.b.v.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The instructions were to put as much detail as you could, so I rather
hubristically attempted to add some technical details in the hopes that it would
set me above the competition. It also proves I was pretty well into it that
evening. As it turns out, the exam room contained a gin rather than a whisky,
which had been aged in oak barrels. It was really good and I've been informed
that it's available at Bi-Rite in San Francisco and intend to make my way down
there to get a bottle for myself as in addition to my newly acquired scotch
habit I'm also a gin drinker. So I wasn't all that far from the mark and I have
to confirm with Randall but I'm pretty sure the alcohol content conforms to my
guess as well. However I didn't take first place since a gentleman from Engine
Yard had received a bottle of the very same gin for his birthday and had sampled
it the previous night. There are two possible reasons for the events which
followed. Either everyone else was way more drunk than I was, or I have an
incredibly silver-tongued alter ego when drunk. I managed to convince Randall
that A: The guy from Engine Yard kinda sorta cheated by having had some the
previous night, and B: There should really be a runner-up prize anyway. By the
strangest of coincidences I just so happened to be the runner-up. Fancy that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night, they found an untouched bottle of the Murray McDavid to
award me with and I have been saving it for the launch of my side project which
I will talk about in a later post when it's closer to being done. Right now the
powers that be (school) have conspired to take all of my free time and replace
it with homework. If there's any justice I should have it up and running by the
end of May, but Tanj!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fandabbydozy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about it... well, the Fandabbydozy was brought from Scotland
under unusual circumstances but we drank all the evidence of it away so it
should be fine to discuss. It was excellent. Certainly the first time I'd had a
single cask whisky. I didn't pick up as many of the flavors described on the
bottle but I certainly did enjoy my first, and second, and third drams of this
bottle. (Randall was very generous with it though I tried to protest and let
other people enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo credit goes to Jacob Helwig.The originals are [here][1]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In the End&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great night, I took home a bottle of Laphroaig for my
fanatical devotion to flavor and by the time I left I was sober enough that I
got back to Union Square without getting lost. Thanks again to everyone at
GitHub and Engine Yard, the CodeConf speakers, fellow volunteers and attendees,
and in particular to Tom and Theresa Preston-Werner, Jacob Helwig, Steve
Klabnick, and Chris Bertels, all of whom were a source of excellent conversation
throughout the weekend. It turns out Chris and I work in the same office suite,
with different folks and in opposite corners so I'll likely be pestering him
about Fancy for some time. And lastly, a HUUUGE thanks to Craig for his
fantastic presentation and excellent conversation. I look forward to having a
few drinks with you next time you're in San Francisco. If anyone would like more
detail on the scotches or topics I wrote up here, I urge them to ping
@whiskycraig on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Most Interesting Day</title>

    <updated>2011-04-27T11:19:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/27/a-most-interesting-day</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an interesting day. I helped to start an International holiday in
Corenominal Day, stopped for coffee when I was already running late despite the
fact that I loathe being tardy, tolerated and even enjoyed some aspects of
classes today, and got stung by a wasp that got trapped in my beard while I was
cycling home. All in all, today was quite eventful. Though I still didn't get as
much done as I {needed,intended,wanted}. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are listening to James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader) reading Edgar Allen

    <title>The Wakemate: A Review After Three Months</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/15/the-wakemate-a-review-after-three-months/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-15T11:11:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/15/the-wakemate-a-review-after-three-months</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: The WakeMate is great, if you like waking up feeling rested or hate
wasting time sleeping then this is for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sleephacking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a hacker, and as you might surmise, there are a few stereotypes and
connotations associated with that word. The first being that I spend my nights
in front of a computer subverting corrupt governments and stealing half pennies
at a time from banks that will never miss them. While the latter half of this is
false, I do spend many nights, such as the full six it took to write this blog
post over the last three months, in front of a computer screen. The other half,
which you may be less aware of, is that hackers are notorious for refusing to
cave to the pressures of the outside, be it peer pressure, financial pressure,
or otherwise. When someone tells a hacker something is impossible, chances are
all you did was challenge them to make it so. As a result, any time someone in
my life tells me I need to sleep more often, I'm driven to improve my ability to
function on an absolute minimum of sleep necessary to sustain full cognitive
function and bodily health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accomplish this, I use a number of tools and tricks, the latest of
which is the [WakeMate][WM] from Y-Combinator company Perfect Third Labs. This
review has been a long time coming and not everything about my experience with
the WakeMate has been ponies and teddy bears, but enough of it has that I can't
say I'd enjoy returning to life before I was using it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to mention before we dive straight in, is that I am not in
any way affiliated with WakeMate with the exception of working for another YC
company, loving their product, and being on the mailing list for their nightly
and beta Android clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let's dive right in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Does it Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WakeMate's device sits on your wrist at night and monitors your activity during
sleep. It breaks sleep down into awake, light, average, and deep sleep. It can
tell roughly when you're awake, sleeping lightly, or deeply with pretty good
anecdotal accuracy. By that I mean, any night when I've gotten up at four to
peel the cat off my face and chuck her out has registered on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never caught it in an outright lie, so I assume that the data it collects
is at least accurate enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to collecting all this data, the WakeMate will also act as a smart
alarm. If you tell it by when you need to be awake, it will do its best to wake
you up at the optimal time in your sleep cycle up to twenty minutes before the
time you gave. This is the killer feature. The idea that the alarm should get
you up as early as you need to be, but not on time. People are often harmed by
the snooze button as it drags out long periods of dozing in the morning which in
my experience, serve only to leave me feeling rushed rather than refreshed.
WakeMate in an ideal world eliminates the need for both the snooze button as
well as the true alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed about the WakeMate was its selection of alarm
tones. Normally when picking an alarm tone, I go with the most jarring, teeth
grinding, horrid noise I can find in the selection. I do this because I needed
to be properly motivated to turn the thing off and not just let it play.
However, the problem with this practice is that when you're woken up by the
sound of a truckload of pots and pans being dropped out a third story window,
you wake up in a jarred and horrid mood. But the WakeMate's selection of tones
doesn't have any jarring alarms, nor does it allow you to specify your own. This
was clearly done on purpose since part of the product's goal is to wake you up
as gently as possible. The WakeMate's alarm tones (all named for colors) all
begin in a soft pianissimo and gently crescendo to at most a mezzoforte. The
effect of which is more akin to being woken by a lover whispering in your ear
and not your younger brother hitting you with his shoes to let you know it's
time to get up for school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole product is designed to make you feel good when you wake up and
that is an mission which they have largely accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of the WakeMate is the Wakelytics site which helps you
track a your personal sleep score over time as well as give you the ability to
tag any night with specific comments. I've used everything from &lt;code&gt;coffee-10pm&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;couch&lt;/code&gt; though I've not actually looked much at what it does for me. That said,
if you like game mechanics, leaderboards, and sleeping. WakeMate's top sleepers
board might be the place for you to bathe in the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What doesn't it do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is both tricky and simple. Firstly, the WakeMate isn't a magic solution
that you wear on your wrist in order to ward off oversleep demons. If you're
that tired, you'll just sleep through it like any other alarm. It also
isn't the best at preserving your data on Android, there have been a number of
nights where I lost data due to bluetooth bugs, application crashes,
accidentally running the device battery out, and so on. While the betas have
been getting better and better about this, it'd still be nice to have a fallback
such as not deleting data on power cycle but instead having a dedicated (and
somewhat hard to push) reset button. Beyond that, there isn't much advertised
that it doesn't deliver. At this point I think they're on the right path and
just need to step up on the user experience side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I'd like to see&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature that WakeMate lacks for my desired use case is something I'm
going to call a Powernap Button (Feel free to use this if you like fellows.)
Which will let me sleep for a single light -&amp;gt; medium -&amp;gt; heavy -&amp;gt;
medium -&amp;gt; light sleep cycle and then wake me up. Especially on nights which
would otherwise have to be all nighters, this would be massively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another awesome feature would be an API to access live WakeMate data
about my current sleep. It'd be great to wire up the electric kettle to start
heating up once I've entered light sleeping and will soon be woken up and a
million other neat tricks like  beyond that all they really need is a bit of
user side polish and the willingness of people to try new things in order to
free themselves of the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WakeMate is a great tool if you want to tweak your sleeping habits and get
more out of less sleep. I haven't yet taken full advantage of all it has to
offer and the Android client is a little haphazard but constantly getting
better. I'd love to be able to hit a website with a request and get back some
json data of about my current sleep status. That would be fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments from the Posterous Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jon Schwartz&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for a little while now too (I think I was in
the second shipment). I have also found the wrist band to be too tight, so I
turned it inside out as some people suggested on the WM Blog, that solved the
issue. However, it caused another side issue. Now, the wrist band turns off in
the middle of the night (switch gets flipped) and I get woken up at the end
time instead of the correct time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software has gotten much better since version 1 (on Droid 1) and my data
hasn't been lost lost in quite a while. Sometimes, I'll have to power cycle
the wrist band, but it doesn't lose my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, their interface on Android needs a little more spit and polish and I,
too, would love api access. I doubt, however, they could offer us real time
access as I think the wrist band goes into low power mode when it doesn't
detect movement and its not close to wake up time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also that whole situation with the exploding usb charger. I haven't
gotten a replacement, have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I agree with your assessment. The wakemate is a great tool, but I
still haven't shut off my backup alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;K|O|G|I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for almost a month now. I didn't get a charger
with my shipment at all. When I emailed them about it, they said they had
issues with them, and are no longer including them &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; -- they told me
to check Amazon.com and buy one for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steven! Ragnarök&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Jon, I haven't gotten a replacement either, but USB wall warts are a dime a
dozen in my household, so I hadn't even been using it when they sent out the
recall. There's lots of little things with the Android app, like not entering
portrait mode when I crack open the keyboard to type in my login info. Nothing
that makes it unusable in my opinion, but not pleasant by half. Especially not
when you're already half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@KOGI it's a shame they sent you out to Amazon, they should at least recognize
one that they accept. So many of the adapters I've found on Amazon have
shorted out themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comments guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;hjwieland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hy, thanks for your great review! Based on it I have bought a WakeMate, too.
I'm an Android user so it would be great to test the nightly Android client
builds. But I dont find the mailng list of WakeMate you mentioned? Would be
great if you can point me to it. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steven! Ragnarök&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@hjwieland it might just take them a while, They currently have one developer
doing all the work for both Android and Blackberry platforms. If you're
desperately impatient, post your email to @__nil on Twitter as he's the fine
fellow running the show. That seems to be the way the last few guys got in.
Remember that beta means beta which means occasional loss of data. If you
value the stats maybe you should stick with the Market versions. I'm not
fussed about the stats, which is why I volunteered to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;bev&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent post, I have found sleep success with the wakemate and have shaved
off about an hour a night without as much as a yawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're &quot;What I’d like to see&quot; rocks. I now want things to come alive just I am
waking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Computer Science Education in Silicon Valley</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-22T09:11:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;a.k.a: &lt;em&gt;Dear SJSU pls stop making me memorize the Java API, my degree is in
Comp. Sci. not JDK 1.6 kthxbaiSTFU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would think that being in the heart of Silicon Valley, the very birthplace
of the personal computer, would be a colossal advantage to a student of computer
science and mathematics who is pursuing software development as a career. Sadly,
this is not the case. The curriculum and course materials taught by the two
local community colleges I've attended in the past and the university at which I
am enrolled is frightfully out of date. But not nearly as paleolithic as the
evaluation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two kinds of computer science courses (10 different kinds
for those in the know), implementation classes and theory classes. The bulk of
my criticism here lies in theimplementation classes. When I started taking
programming classes in college, I began with Intro to Programming in Java and
Programming I in C++. My father, a games developer from days of yore took the
courses with me for laughs. In class, there was a computer at every seat, we
took our notes directly in the text editor, ran code that was being written on
the board live and often times had to correct errors in the professor's code
while he was writing it out. However, all our exams were handwritten and thus
there was no way to check our code against the compiler. In intro to programming
this isn't really a big deal, but later down the road in Object Oriented Design
and Patterns, we're being asked to write snippets of complex GUI programs
utilizing &lt;em&gt;__dozens))&lt;/em&gt; of standard library classes and methods. In one course,
the solution for this was a single laptop with the standard Java API
documentation on it that the students could wait in line for &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the exam.
In another, it is allowing each student to have a packet of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; 8.5 x 11 pages
on the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;th test of the semester.In this modern world where APIs are subject to
change and up-to-date documentation on every thing (except Ruby's Net::HTTP,
Oh Snap!) is readily available online, wasting brain-space memorizing API calls
is downright fscking stupid and I refuse to do it. This is another incarnation
of the classic fable &quot;Give a man a fish, he will pass a test. Teach him to RTFM,
he will actually be a software developer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so far had only one class where the exam was to write a program, at a
computer and submit it in an inbox by the end of the class period. This is
absolutely the correct way to do things. The professor told us at the beginning
of the exam that perusing the docs (.Net) online was A-OK but that going
anywhere else would result in an F on the exam. He didn't even really walk
around and check. He had the wisdom to realize that cheaters will cheat and that
the internet can only help so much if you don't know what you're doing. Those
exams were not only more straightforward, fun, and challenging, but also the
most educational I have had within the realm of software development thus far
in the five years I've been a college student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, if you're given the opportunity to teach a batch of computer
scientists, ask yourself if your class is about concepts or coding and if the
latter, write your test to be implemented on the computer in 90 minutes time.
None of their future employers give two shits about whether or not they know
what method to call on JDialog to get the output you want. That can be looked
up. They're looking for confident implementers who can pick up with a new
language or framework in an afternoon and get started right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Try to Be Satisfied With Partial Credit and You Should Too</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-07T11:42:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows about partial credit, partial credit is what happens when you
half-ass that essay, or forget to start that assignment until the morning before
its due. Sometimes, partial credit comes at you completely out of the blue, when
you thought you had the assignment in the bag. If you're professor is really out
to get you, then they will only give &quot;full credit&quot; for &quot;outstanding work&quot;,
whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got partial credit in early elementary school because I picked things up
rather quickly and once I'd gotten the hang of things, I stopped working at them
and went back to Mario or Sonic. I got partial credit in late elementary and
middle school because I didn't understand the value of what I was learning at
the time. I got partial credit in high school because there were far too many
things more fun than doing all the assignments or studying for the tests and
quizzes. I get partial credit in college because I work for a living, and like
it, and try to maintain the shambles that is my personal life. I've never been
the sort to focus on school, but that doesn't mean I don't agonize every time I
get an assignment back with less than perfect. Autograded assignments such as
those for calculus and physics, or most horribly, an online submission for a
computer program, which gives you instant and mercilessly objective feedback.
Well, it's like a drug, like failing to get the high score when the initials
you're trying to beat are those of the jock kid who used the allowance from his
rich parents to woo away your girlfriend. I just keep putting quarters in until
I'm completely tapped. I recently sent an email to one of my professors because
the amount of out-of-class work for their class for one week exceeded the time I
spent sleeping and doing work for all my other classes combined for that week,
which anyone must be forced to admit, is a little absurd. The reply I got was
simply this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;just do the best you can, and call it a day. Everyone is subjected to the
same thing...  You don't need to get every single point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to get every single point. In my estimation, there are two*
primary reasons professors assign as much as they do. Either they firmly believe
that their class is the only one you should be taking that semester and that you
aren't doing anything else or they've completely forgotten the insanity of
undergraduate studies. So you can see that getting such a candid admission that
collecting all the points is not necessary to knowing the material. And indeed,
I had a week previously received the highest grade in the class on the exam.
(45/50, not all the pointseven then.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes two hands to count the number of times I conciously took partial credit
in the last month. Sometimes it was to study harder for another class or
complete an assignment that was weighted more heavily, sometimes it was to wrap
up a project for work, and other times it was just because the coffee was hot,
the conversation good and I didn't want to pull out my books and give up the
conversation. Some nights I just wanted to put in a full night's rest. But I do
it, I try to use it sparingly, but I'm also not going to commit ritual suicide
when that ugly &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; shows up on my transcript at the end of the semester. A
complete stranger might see that and see a student who &quot;didn't apply himself
fully&quot; or some other nonsense. But my girlfriend will see it as the week I spent
visiting her, my employer will see it as the projects I stayed up all night
finishing to be ready the next morning, and my old friend will see it as the
rainy afternoon at the coffee house we spent catching up and ignoring the world.
I'll see it as a representation of the rewards for my effort in balancing the
many aspects of my life and I'll have the knowledge of what I learned to judge
for myself what portion of the education offered I took for myself. I generally
find that I got what I wanted and often much much more. So, the next time you're
faced with a choice between catching up with an old friend, or getting a full
night's sleep for the first time in a month, and getting a passing grade or full
credit on an assignment, just remember: &quot;You don't need to get every single
point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There is a third less common reason that is quite popular with math teachers
and that is that C is defined as average and is therefore where they want most
of their students to fall with a standard bell curve around it and grading
convention be damned... sadists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Initial Commit</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/10/26/initial-commit/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-26T02:27:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/10/26/initial-commit</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I doubt there is anyone actually going to my website. I refuse to employ
silly Google Analytics for a toy site like my own. I'm in the unfortunate
position of being both rubbish at design, and very particular about it. Thus, I
do something with my website that I like at the time, and then can't bring
myself to go back to it because I know I won't like it and end up redoing it
from scratch, but I have all of these things I've been meaning to write down. I
guess I'll do it here. I picked posterous because I can just write myself emails
and they accidentally become public, so I better not talk about the money I've
stashed in the third tree on the left near the playground outside my old
school...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a number of things have happened since I last wrote anything longer than
140 chars on the internet. The whole microblagging thing is one of them. I have
become somewhat enamored of identi.ca, my usage of which increased heavily after
I got a twitter account for my job. Not so much the format, though I do find it
a challenge against my natural verbosity, but the people. People make a social
network and Identi.cats are some of the coolest folk on the great wide online.
Having been inspired by the work and play of my fellow #neckbeards and free
software users, I decided to spend more time contributing back to community. I
think a lot of this will come in the form of documentation, bug reporting, and
baked goods for the locals. Part of this was reconstructing my online presence.
So here I am. I make no promises of regularity, nor about what content will
follow this, if any. But if I become moved to write about something, it will
more than likely manifest itself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, I guess I have a blog now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven!&lt;/p&gt;
