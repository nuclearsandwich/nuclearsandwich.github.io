    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last year, and especially in the last two to three months
I have been internalizing and witnessing for myself the extreme benefits of
accompanying your code with a test suite which matches your code in quality.
By this I mean that it is difficult (and damn frustrating) to write good tests
for poor code. At my current skill level as a programmer there's code in my
primary code base that is so bad (yep, I wrote that code too) that I am unable
to write good tests for it. Up until four or five weeks ago, coinciding with my
second readings of &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book&quot;&gt;The RSpec Book&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book&quot;&gt;The Cucumber Book&lt;/a&gt;, sitting in
as a guest panelist on &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyrogues.com/book-club-exceptional-ruby/&quot;&gt;Ruby Rogues&lt;/a&gt;, and watching a bunch of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts&quot;&gt;Destroy All Software&lt;/a&gt;, I realized that in order to gain the benefits of TDD
being touted by some of the most respected members of the Ruby community, I
needed better tests. Specifically better isolated tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Isolated Tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had to completely justify my desire to add and grow isolated tests
for production code. The argument against doing so was simply that if the &lt;em&gt;whole
point&lt;/em&gt; of isolated tests is to know when something breaks in the future, an
integrated test suite will pick up those failures just as well. Therefore
isolated tests are a waste of time and engineering effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; correct, provided the only thing you use your isolated tests
for is protection from regressions. However, doing so leaves out what is to my
mind the &lt;strong&gt;greatest&lt;/strong&gt; and most profound advantage of isolated testing, which is
immediate, focused feedback. I definitely think I'm inventing terms here so
please indulge me while I clarify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediate: &lt;em&gt;The result (success or failure) can be observed right away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused: &lt;em&gt;The cause of any failure is known to be within the system under
test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has worked in software for a substantial amount of time knows that
we are each our own worst enemy and the temptation to add unnecessary complexity
is a constant bother. How many of us have added arguments to methods only to
use the default value every time. I call these bullshit arguments, because they
piss me off when I have to put up with them. The joy in a test with truly
immediate feedback is the laser focus that they give you when working on a
system. You're literally doing one thing at a time and checking that you get the
expected result even when it isn't success. When you get the failure you expect,
you simply move on, and when you get an unexpected failure it causes you to
identify the disparity between your mental model of the system and the computer
model and correct it. Since these tests are isolated and generally run in less
than a second, there is essentially no penalty for running the tests with
monstrous frequency. When you do have to stop, it is to make a correction,
even if it is just a mental correction. The time you save fixing it early is
more than enough to justify the low cost of running the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the downsides of this type of testing is that you are treating anything
which isn't the system under test as an external service and therefore
stubbing the interactions with it. This works great for fast, clean-room tests
but it means that the burden of ensuring that the assumptions you make in one
test are validated in the respective tests for your other systems is entirely on
the programmer and since programmers are human, this will eventually lead to
mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite aspect of isolated tests is how informative they can be
about your system. It's pretty common knowledge that if your tests are a pain in
the ass to write, it's a good indication that your code is too-tightly coupled
and refactoring to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/&quot;&gt;Law of Demeter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/055-issue-23-solid-design.html&quot;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt; design
principles is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Integrated Tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the scariest things that happened to me in recent memory was discovering
that people were surprised when after arguing in favor of getting higher quality
unit tests I was still unsatisfied because our integrated tests also needed
attention and improvement. I found this a little disturbing (okay, I found this
really disturbing) because I can't imagine how long it would take to manually
verify that I didn't overlook anything in the major refactoring or feature
addition I just performed. I certainly don't budget the time to manually test
every resource and parameter combination by hand. I might do so initially
because a major disadvantage to integrated tests is in the difficulty of doing
exploratory testing at this level. As a result, when writing integrated tests, I
tend to rely on manual experimentation to determine how my system behaves in
undefined situations, make a decision on the appropriateness of that behavior
and then solidify that set of interactions into a group of tests. One of the
nice things about integrated tests is that once written, they tend not to change
unless your expected end-user behavior changes. This is afforded by the
&quot;bigger picture&quot; nature of integrated tests where you are less concerned with
the exact behavior of any one unit and instead are validating the result of
system-wide operation and interaction. Thus, integrated tests are largely immune
to internal refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one can imagine, the strengths of isolated tests are the weaknesses of
integrated tests. When something is wrong, particularly in a complex interaction
that touches many parts of the system, it can be unclear exactly where the
problem in the codebase is when an integrated test fails. If you get an actual
exception, you'll have a stacktrace to guide you, but those tend to be unhelpful
errors like an unexpected nil and rarely is it obvious at what level the nil was
assigned and how long it had been propagated upward until the failure. So it
can be said that integrated tests are not focused since there is no indication
of precisely where in the system the failure has occurred. Additionally,
integrated tests mandate that you test your full software stack. Any persistence
layers, external services, background tasks, and other specific tools you're
using should be tested during this phase. As you can imagine testing all of
these things takes time and computing power. It is not feasible to expect even
a subset of an integrated test suite to run in the same magnitude of time as
isolated tests, what this means is the tests are no longer immediate. Thus,
they are not suitable for running at every pass of your TDD cycle. Only when you
believe the feature to be complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if isolated tests don't identify incongruities between subsystems and
integrated tests are too slow to run during an immediate feedback TDD cycle,
which do you use? As you may have surmised from the title, the answer is...
both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book&quot;&gt;The Cucumber Book&lt;/a&gt; suggests that &quot;It's sometimes said that unit tests ensure
you 'build the thing right', while acceptance tests ensure you 'build the
right thing'.&quot; I also like Avdi Grim's simile of mocks being like hydrogen
peroxide in that they both fizz up around problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our twin goals of systematic coverage and focus during development in mind,
let's recap how each set of tests is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you know what you you're building but not how, reach for the integrated
tests. Define the desired outcome at the high level and then run that test again
when you think you've got it down. Start thinking about the different aspects of
that problem and decomposing them. Then devise a system of smaller tests
mirroring the smaller objects and functions you'll use to accomplish that goal.
Isolated tests are there once you're ready to do exactly that. There to aid
you in that mission and guide you toward good design decisions. &quot;I'll do what
the tests tell me&quot; is not an uncommon phrase from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Isolated regression tests are a side effect of good TDD, they're more important
during the process than after.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrated tests are the ones you bring home and show your mother. The ones you
can be proud of at the end of the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wasn't really happy with my first first post on this shiny new blog, so I
thought I would make a second first post and yammer on a bit about why I publish
nonsense like this on the internets anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;em&gt;who am I now?&lt;/em&gt; Basically I am not anybody. I'm a student of Computer Science
and Mathematics at San José State University. I have been fiddling with
computers my whole life but would say that the decision to not suck, or at
software design only happened about a year and a half ago. My entire formal
education save for one class which I only had last semester has been Java save
for a course each in C and C++, both of which were taught by a professor who had
to mentally translate everything into Java and then translate it back to answer
the question. As a result, I'm really behind in a lot of stuff I shouldn't be
behind in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Look at Ruby Case Expressions</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/09/08/a-look-at-ruby-case-expressions/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-08T08:33:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/09/08/a-look-at-ruby-case-expressions</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ruby, like many languages has a case-when construct for more refined conditional
execution than if-then-else can provide. Technically all case constructs could
be written as if-then-else-if-then...else but you wouldn't enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ruby's case-when is an expression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of things that make Ruby's case-when special. The
first comes from Ruby's functional roots. It's powerful but deceptively simple.
Ruby's case-when construct is an &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt;. Which means, among other things,
it returns a value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a traditional imperative style a case statement might look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:some_default_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;our_condition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:one_thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:another&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The that isn't ideal for a number of reasons. &lt;code&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/code&gt; is set
visibly three times which as any freshman can tell you is frowned upon.
Academics have stuffier reasons for it but the most important is that it
decreases readability because we aren't sure what the value will be after
execution. Setting it so many times is also a code duplication, albeit a small
one. We can take advantage of Ruby's case-when &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt; with this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;our_condition&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                       &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                         &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:one_thing&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                       &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                         &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:another&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                       &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                         &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:some_default_value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;                       &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Doesn't that look nicer? &lt;code&gt;conditional_variable&lt;/code&gt; is only set once and the
intent is clear, we want the value to depend on &lt;code&gt;our_condition&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;case-when uses triple equals for comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got me good this morning and spawned this article. If you're not familiar
with &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; in Ruby then the best explanation comes from &lt;em&gt;_why's Poignant Guide
to Ruby&lt;/em&gt; which really is worth reading. I've referred back to it multiple times
to help myself and those around me fully understand basic Ruby concepts like
&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, truthiness and falsiness, and, &lt;strong&gt;fanfare please&lt;/strong&gt;, double equals versus
triple equals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double equals gives the appearance of a short link of ropes, right
along the sides of a red carpet where only &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; can be admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;approaching_guy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;That necklace is classic&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...
[This case-when statement]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1894&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Born.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1895&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1913&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Childhood in Lousville, Winston Co., Mississippi.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No information about this year.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;is identical to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1895&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1913&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Childhood in Lousville, Winston Co., Mississippi.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;No information about this year.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;triple equals&lt;/strong&gt; is a length of velvet rope, checking values much like
the &lt;strong&gt;double equals&lt;/strong&gt;. It's just: the triple equals is a longer rope and it
sags a bit in the middle. It's not as strict, it's a bit more flexible.
Take the Ranges above. &lt;code&gt;(1895..1913)&lt;/code&gt; isn't at all equal to &lt;code&gt;1905&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the Range &lt;code&gt;(1895..1913)&lt;/code&gt; is only truly equal to any other Range
&lt;code&gt;(1895..1913)&lt;/code&gt;. In the case of a Range, the triple equals cuts you a break
and lets the Integer &lt;code&gt;1905&lt;/code&gt; in, because even though it's not equal to the
Range, it's included in the set of Integers represented by the Range. Which
is good enough in some cases, such as the timeline I put together earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Mistake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I did which caused me to write this as penance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;local_tweet_object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tweet_hash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# the screw-up&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;MultiJson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ArgumentError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Cannot process &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; only String or Hash&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;LocalTweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tweet_hash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This code was raising the following error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ArgumentError: I don't want Hash give me only String or Hash&lt;/code&gt;
... &lt;em&gt;huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance it looked fine, but then we remember that case-when uses &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;.
Again, we think &quot;this shouldn't be an issue, if it's good enough for &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; it
should be fine for &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;.&quot; But &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; behaves specially for certain types in Ruby
such as Classes, Arrays, and as we saw before, Ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simple scalar values &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; acts like you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=''&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;12 === 12 #=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;12 === 13 #=&gt; false
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;:rats === :rats #=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&quot;pens&quot; === &quot;pens&quot; #=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&quot;space&quot; === &quot;fact&quot; #=&gt; false&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we know how &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; treats ranges&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=''&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;(8..64) === 32 #=&gt; true&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But note that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=''&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;(8..64) === (8..64) #=&gt; false&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suddenly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=''&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;Integer === 12 #=&gt; true!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;waitaminute.. what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Ruby can tell that &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; is a type of Integer and thus &lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt; can be described
partially as an includes and typeof operator. But there are some further
gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=''&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;[ 1, 2, 3 ] === 1#=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;[ 1, 2, 3 ] === [ 1, 2, 3 ]                         #=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;[ 1, 2, 3 ] === [ 1, 2 ]                            #=&gt; false
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;{ :foo =&gt; :bar } === { :foo =&gt; :bar }               #=&gt; true
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;{ :foo =&gt; :bar } === :foo                           #=&gt; false
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;{ :foo =&gt; :bar, :baz =&gt; :qux } === { :foo =&gt; :bar } #=&gt; false&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;===&lt;/code&gt;'s behavior isn't completely intuitive even within Ruby's standard Classes.
Which brings us (finally) back around to my original error.
&lt;code&gt;Hash === Hash #=&amp;gt; false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;case input.class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;to&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;case input&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I posted on identi.ca a friendly notice about this easy mistake and was&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;asked to provide clarification. So here, just over 24 hours late, it is.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Or as Steve Klabnik puts it more precisely and politely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;factories are integration tests by definition, because they do not exercise a

    <title>Why Ruby Needs Heroes</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/08/19/why-ruby-needs-heroes/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-19T12:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/08/19/why-ruby-needs-heroes</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A reflection on the Ruby community's tendency to celebrate individual
developers and what good comes of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ruby community isn't unique in its tendency for celebrating rockstar
developers but after examining the communities history it would seem that we
burn them out bright and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first became involved in the community I had heard of almost no one. My
first hero is my friend Erik Ostrom to whom I owe a great deal for my first and
second introductions to Ruby. Without you Erik I would be missing out on the
most fun, passionate, and rewarding hacking I have ever done. I have you to
thank for my introductions to rhe MVC pattern, idiomatic programming, and the
process of developing software. I also owe you a big thanks for pointing me to
_why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leads nicely into my second hero &lt;em&gt;why the lucky stiff. The Guide when I
first read it was the most refreshing and maddeningly beautiful piece of
technical literature I had ever encountered and remains so to this day. Never
before had I seen a language presented side by side with English hold its
expressiveness the way Ruby did. It took me three tries to finish the Guide but
I have read over its pages many times reminding myself to &quot;use what Ruby gives
[me]&quot; and it is still my goto for explaining nil, truthiness, and falsiness in
Ruby. If I were to teach programming in an art department, The Guide would be my
textbook. But &lt;/em&gt;why gave me more than the guide. Through Camping I was able to
study &quot;magic&quot; and be exposed to the raw untamed power of metaprogramming in
Ruby. Even though I had missed the whole hullabaloo surrounding _why's exit
from the community by a matter of weeks his work has had a lasting and profound
effect on me and I thank him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many developers my first full application in Ruby and real test of what I
learned was using Ruby on Rails. Rails 2.3.5 to be precise. This marks me as a
new kid on the block I know, but let's face it, I am. I have been living with
Ruby for little more than two years. But that's the evolution of community
without new blood it dries out. Anyway through this early stage I had a
collection of mentors. The most prolific of which wasn't even aware of it at the
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Bates, your Railscasts helped guide me not only on specific challenges I
was facing building my first production app but also provided my first exposure
to lots of quality Ruby code and process. One thing the Ruby community gets on a
fundamental level is that process matters and you were my first big introduction
to that. You also introduced me to rvm and by extension my next hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wayne Seguin, rvm is a colossal undertaking. Managing development environments
has always been a pain and you shaved one of the biggest, hairiest yaks ever to
stand in the middle of the room.
MixedMetaphorException: &quot;Yaks aren't elephants.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are also a fabulous example of a project maintainer I don't have a specific
IRC story of my own but that only speaks to the quality of your work. You're
also a wonderful example of a polyglot Rubyist and really show what can happen
when Rubyists take their knowledge and experience and apply it to funny little
languages like bash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last April I had the pleasure of meeting Steve Klabnik at the very first
CodeConf. One of the coolest things about you Steve is that you're pretty much
my age. It was so inspiring to see you, such an obviously accepted member of the
Ruby community, so close to my own age. You indirectly informed me that the amount
of effort required to really get involved and make a difference wasn't in the
depressingly distant future and this has motivated me substantially in my
efforts to give back even as I receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks man, you rock&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been reading a lot of stuff from Avdi Grimm. You're style is so
refined and decisive. Few people think about the meaning and reason behind their
code and design decisions as you clearly do. Lately I have been turning to your
writings when I find myself wondering about the best way to do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my journey through Ruby has brought me across the paths of these heroes and
so many more. But what motivates me to think of these fine folks this way even
when they may not want the attention. How many feel overly pressured by or
undeserving of their status. When thinking on this, I am reminded of Firefly.
(If you haven't seen it, seriously do yourself a favor and watch it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/images/blog/jaynestown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jaynestown&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically the Hero of Canton episode in which Jayne, the least noble of the
protagonists, is remembered as a folk hero on a backwater mining colony for
accidentally dropping crates of money over the mining camps. At the end Jayne
can't understand what they see in him when dropping the money at all was simply
a dishonest mistake as the episode wraps up he's told that the statue in his
honor isn't for him, it is for the miners. We build heroes out of you because we
see qualities in you we hope to someday find in ourselves. So please, whether
you're a Jayne Cobb or Malcom Reynolds, if someone thinks of you as their hero,
just be proud that you've done something extraordinary and they hope to follow
suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy _whyday,
Steven!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CoffeeScript: An Outsider Opinion</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/07/03/coffeescript-an-outsider-opinion/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-03T18:16:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/07/03/coffeescript-an-outsider-opinion</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts on CoffeeScript from a server-side developer just getting started with
frontend and JavaScript development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, if you’re unfamiliar with CoffeeScript, I recommend reading elsewhere
for a proper overview and introduction. The CoffeeScript homepage and the
Introductory Chapter of The Litte CoffeeScript Book are good resources for that.
If you’re really impatient CoffeeScript is in the author’s own words
&quot;JavaScript’s less ostentatious kid brother.&quot; I’ve also heard it called
&quot;Javascript for Ruby and Python programmers&quot; and &quot;What Javascript should have
been&quot; by several of my peers. It also seems that it could’ve been called
CilantroScript&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.com&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; as it seems to have an instantly polarizing effect on people
in online communities such as Reddit and the Ruby on Rails community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So why did I start working with CoffeeScript? A number of reasons.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a backend developer and want to grow my frontend skills.
1. I’m starting to experiment with Node.js on the server.
2. Jeremy Ashkenas’s talk at CodeConf on literate programming blew my mind.
3.I know Ruby, so I should enjoy a “Javascript for Rubyists”, right?
4. It is going to be a Ruby on Rails default soon so I might as well check it
out now.
5. I like new and shiny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the quandries I faced when deciding to learn CoffeeScript was the fact
that I don’t know JavaScript. I spent 6 months noodling with Ruby before picking
up Rails and am still getting my feet wet with Python before taking Django for a
spin. So why on Earth would someone with my MO pick up CoffeeScript without
first becoming proficient with javascript? (Aside: I’m tired of the CamelCasing)
The answer comes from the first sentence (topic sentence, for those still in Jr.
High School) in the second paragraph of the coffeescript home page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: “It’s just JavaScript”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out that isn’t entirely true since coffeescript is a class based
object oriented language and javascript is prototype based. This was actually a
mark against coffeescript for me since part of my desire to learn javascript was
to dally in prototype based OOP. (Luckily there’s still Io for that.) But for
the most part Coffee really is just javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT: Jeremy Ashkenas has kindly clarified this point for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoffeeScript is prototype based to the precise same extent that JavaScript is.
The &quot;class&quot; keyword is just sugar for JavaScript’s constructor function +
prototype chain combination. To mangle Shakespeare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s in a name? That which we call a class by any other name would smell
as sweet. Call it a prototype if you like — it’s the same thing in code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Jeremy, apologies for misapprehending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So why the bother?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back I invested some of my hard-earned and short-in-supply cash to pick
up a ten-pack of PeepCode tokens. I have to say, I’ve derived an intense amount
of value from PeepCode but more on that later. I started with PeepCode’s Meet
CoffeeScript, had they produced a Meet JavaScript I would have started there,
but they didn’t. It took around six hours to watch the three and a half hour
video. Almost immediately after, I started PeepCode’s Meet Node.js screencast
and attempted to do it in javascript for about eight minutes. The appeal of
coffeescript was immediately clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In JavaScript, I have to worry about whether or not every line ends in a
semicolon, that there are no extraneous commas, yet commas where necessary,
and that I’ve remembered the var keyword on all my local variables. All that
stuff is important in JavaScript it doesn’t actually effect my application in
any way. In CoffeeScript, I can focus on the behavior of my code rather than the
presentation of it. Instead of scrutinizing each line for a semicolon and each
block for matching curly braces. I’m affirming that all my variables are scoped
properly and that my code does what I want it to do. It doesn’t add much to
javascript but rather, reduces the amount of worry and focus on what is at the
end of the day arbitrary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I have Vim configured with the fantastic Synastic plugin and I get
notified when I drop a semicolon or have an unmatched brace but what’s the
point? Basic sanity checking is all it can really do. Why even waste the time
to go back and insert those in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still continuing my education in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Node.js,
and prototype-based OOP. I’m armed with the beta copy of the CoffeeScript book
by Trevor Burnham from Pragmatic Programmers. I fully intend to use CoffeeScript
for all of my development in Javascript environments, server- and client-side,
work and play, for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cilantro (or Coriander) is an herb which to some people tastes pleasantly
citrus-like and to others is rank and revolting or soapy. As a result many
people either love it or hate it. Few are ambivalent about Cilantro. The same
is true of CoffeeScript in my observation.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>A Sane Configuration Setup for Rack Applications on Heroku</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/06/25/a-sane-configuration-setup-for-rack-applications-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-25T09:05:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/06/25/a-sane-configuration-setup-for-rack-applications-on-heroku</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Github repo I linked at the end of this article was private
and I forgot to make it public. It is now, sorry. ~Steven!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Nowmov has started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; for application
deployment. In the past I've always been hesitant toward &quot;hosted
solutions&quot; but a combination of focusing my time and the flexibility and
power of Heroku's Celadon Cedar stack has brought me into contact with
one such solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first peculiarities/gotchas/side-effects of many of these
hosted solutions is that they don't provide shell or ftp access. Nor can
you write to the file system from your application. This caused us some
interesting problems during the migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rails convention dictates that &lt;code&gt;config/settings.yml&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;config/database.yml&lt;/code&gt; and friends not be stored in source control and
that we should store template files instead so developers are aware of
setup specific configuration details. However, our inability to push
files not in source control to Heroku leaves us unable to use the
standard convention for configuration details. The way Heroku bypasses
this leads to the next hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point of Heroku is that you don't deal with IT, just your
code. This means that you don't really care where your PostgreSQL
database is or what port you use to connect to your Redis instance. But
you still need to connect to those things! So what does Heroku do? They
give you environment variables. &lt;code&gt;heroku run 'echo $DATABASE_URL'&lt;/code&gt;
returns a big long uri corresponding to your app's database. With this
specific config variable, Heroku is kind enough to render a
&lt;code&gt;database.yml&lt;/code&gt; from it using erb. But it only works ActiveRecord
compatible database.ymls, which is not all of them, believe it or not.
(I'm looking at you Sequel) Inspect your Heroku config variables by
running &lt;code&gt;heroku config&lt;/code&gt; from an app directory. The amount of scary
looking crap in there might surprise you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can even add your own config variables such as
&lt;code&gt;MR_FANCY_PANTS=the_worlds_best_pants&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;heroku config:add MR_FANCY_PANTS=sad_deep_inside ARTIST=&quot;Jonathan
Coulton&quot;&lt;/code&gt; this command will expose both your variables to your code
using Ruby's &lt;code&gt;ENV&lt;/code&gt; hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your code you'd get to it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#!ruby&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;controller_action&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ARTIST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Jonathan Coulton&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@still_alive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But then this also has to work locally! So you need to do somethig like
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#!ruby&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;controller_action&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ARTIST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SETTINGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:artist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Jonathan Coulton&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@still_alive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could set up all these environment variables using a
rake or thor task before launching your app but who wants to deal with
that? My favorite solution to a problem is a coding solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you have to do that &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; you want to use a situation
specific configuration. I don't know about you but that seems hacky,
error prone, and repetitive to me. Smelly code, in other words. In
working on my recent projects I've been studying a large number of small
Ruby applications. Mostly Sinatra but some in Rails and Padrino as well.
In all those apps, I never found a ubiquitously deployed solution for
the configuration situation in a Heroku-style environment so I left it
to simmer a few days and dealt with &lt;code&gt;ENV[:KEY] || SETTINGS['key']&lt;/code&gt; all
over my app. Then, over too much cold brew coffee I came up with a
workable solution. While this is the very first time I've seen this
solution in a web application. It actually comes from messing around in
&lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; earlier in the week trying to alter prompt strings for vanity's sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone open &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; right now! Just go to a terminal and do it! Got it? Okay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; IRB.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see how this inspired my solution later on. Or perhaps I'm not as
brilliant as I think I am and it's obvious to you already (&lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let's say we're working on a lightweight Sinatra application and we
know that it'll start simple and grow in complexity later on. Since
we're smart we're going to namespace the whole thing under a module.
Namely &lt;code&gt;Saneconf&lt;/code&gt; Our skeleton looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;Main Application File - app.rb &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;21&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;24&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class='code' width='100%'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='rb'&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#!ruby&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;rubygems&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Only needed for Ruby 1.8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;bundler&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# After this line, I shouldn&amp;#39;t even have to *think* about dependencies.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This is the initilization file for the Saneconf API. All set up, library&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# loading and application level settings are done here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Saneconf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# If there&amp;#39;s a better/safer way to do this generically do let me know.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;So nice to be sane again, eh? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ARTIST&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That looks cool and all, but what the hell is &lt;code&gt;config/setup.rb&lt;/code&gt;? Answer: It's
where the magic happens, let's go take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure role=code&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Magic Happens Here - config/setup.rb &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class='line'&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='line'&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Saneconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;RESQUE_SCHEDULE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Saneconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;RESQUE_SCHEDULE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='line'&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Saneconf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;conf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;freeze&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All this does is check for the existence of a &lt;code&gt;settings.yml&lt;/code&gt; and load  it's
values into our (currently) empty configuration hash using an  in-place
&lt;code&gt;#merge!&lt;/code&gt;. The reason we do this is because we very  purposefully didn't supply
a mutator &lt;code&gt;Saneconf.conf=&lt;/code&gt; for our config  hash. We don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; it to be
overwritten later on. For the moment  though we can change existing keys and add
new ones. Next we handle all  non-scalar configuration by parsing some of the
scalar ones into hashes.  Arrays or any other Ruby object could be placed in the
&lt;code&gt;conf&lt;/code&gt; hash. It  just happens that Hashes are commonly used by libraries like
ActiveRecord and the Ruby Redis interface for initialization. The reason  I
expand those here and not in place at point-of-use is mostly personal
preference. All I ever want to see in the app is &lt;code&gt;conf['VARIABLE']&lt;/code&gt; and  I
shouldn't have to think about it and whatever I'm trying to accomplish  at that
point in our app. Lastly, we call &lt;code&gt;#freeze&lt;/code&gt; on the conf hash.  This is a method
every Ruby object has which makes it immutable,  throwing an exception if an
attempt is made to change it. This way, any  of your fellow developers will know
that whatever they're doing belongs  in your application initialization code and
not in the middle of your  important code.   Hopefully this proves helpful, the
example code is available on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nuclearsandwich/saneconf&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good hunting, Steven!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Engine Yard Whisky Dinner, CodeConf 2011</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/05/02/engine-yard-whisky-dinner-code-conf-2011/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-02T10:10:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/05/02/engine-yard-whisky-dinner-code-conf-2011</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5/3/11: Scroll to the bottom to see a near comprehensive list of what
we drank. If I missed anything, do let me know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I'd like to thank Engine Yard for knowing that geeks tend to be
inter-disciplinary and enjoy geeky discussion of things other than code! They
also made an excellent choice in inviting Craig because he's clearly one of the
biggest geeks on the planet... in the field of Scotch Whisky. Since the Whisky
dinner was at Engine Yard's office a group from the Convore chat for the
conference decided to meet at and walk from the hotel. I had to run back to the
Nowmov office to grab the rest of my stuff since I was intending to take the
train home directly from dinner. So myself, Steve Klabnik, Tom Preston-Werner
and his wife, and a bunch of other folks from the conference all walked down
over together. About three blocks from the hotel, I found $20. I'm not lying,
nor am I lying when I say that that was without a doubt the worst part of my
evening. The rest was just that awesome. Upon arrival we were told to snag
t-shirts, which were created specially for the evening and parodied GitHub's
&quot;Fork You&quot; shirts, which you can customize with your GitHub handle by placing
your name on the back in the blank after http://github.com/________, in case you
haven't seen them yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After snagging a shirt, we were directed toward the &quot;soft drinks&quot; which
consisted of Guinness, Stella Artois, and Lagunitas IPA. It was hard not to
notice the sea of clear plastic cups all around us, each filled with a small
measure of brown liquid. I had a beer or two over good conversation while Craig
and Randall were finishing up. I have to admin, I was a little anxious to get
started as I noticed that on the last table was a bottle marked Lagavulin, which
is a distillery which comes highly recommended by @vanden and @mcnalu on
Identi.ca, but which I haven't been able to try yet. Add to that, the fact that
it is getting on toward 8:25 and the last train home for the night departs at
9:15 and is a ten minute walk away. Things finally start up and Randall
introduces Craig, who is very tall and has been wandering around enigmatically
the whole time. After a brief introduction by Randall, Craig tells us a little
about his history and current job:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only difference between myself and an alcoholic is I get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He launches into the official definition of Scotch Malt Whisky which is any
spirit which meets the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is made using malted barley from Scotland exclusively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is distilled in Scotland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is aged in oak barrels for a minimum of three years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's it, that's all that you need! Once everyone is on the same page, he
introduces us to the first whisky of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Johnnie Walker Black Label&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Johnnie Walker, he explains, is significant because it sells. And provides
jobs for a vast number of people relative to the other distilleries. Economic
reasoning aside. We also discuss the very quick finish of the Johnnie Walker
which attempts to make up for some of the sweetness, whilst simultaneously
letting you get another glass without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenfiddich 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the night, Craig's explanations of the different whiskies was both
narrative and informative. Even if you didn't care a hoot about the history of
Scotch whisky, he carried you forward with the story of it. I certainly saw more
faces in rapt attention than lost in smartphones. The Glenfiddich itself was as
smooth as I remember it being when I sampled some at Christmas, it lacked the
complexity of some of the ones we had later that night but I'll definitely
consider it as a potential light whisky, or breakfast whisky, as Craig called
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aberlour 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aberlour was the first of these that really got my attention, it was complex
yet smooth and had a much stronger oaky aroma than the others. Not much was said
about the Aberlour distillery itself though the transition topic between the
Aberlour and the Macallan discussed the difference between Scotches from the
Highlands, Speyside, and Islay. The gist of which was that they have
historically produced whiskies with certain characteristics but that the region
is no surefire indication of the actual product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Macallan 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the Macallan to be a little underwhelming, considering it's such a high
profile Scotch. It certainly wasn't bad, mind you, but it's priced much higher
than Glenfiddich and has a very similar flavor profile. Though, I may have to
revisit it as I drank it rather hurriedly in order to get to the first of the
peated Islay whiskies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Caol Ila 12 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, just, wow. This was the stand-out Scotch of the evening for me.
Tremendously oak aroma which was also present, though subtler, in the taste.
The Caol Ila did not taste as peated as the Lagavulin or many of the whiskies
later enjoyed in the smoking room but it really made up for it with the great
oak flavor. I'm just raving at this point so I'll say no more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lagavulin 16 Year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Lavagulin we were treated to a brief and somewhat premature
announcement regarding the Fandabbydozy and the difficulty getting it into the
country, but more on that later. The Lagavulin has been recommended to me by
@vanden for some time. Basically since I asked the internet for Scotch
recommendations. Sadly I was never able to locate any. But Craig provided I
actually recall feeling a little underwhelmed by it, but I expect that's because
I was so keen on the Caol Ila. This is another one I want to try again a little
earlier in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-Smoking Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Lagavulin we were released into the wild to to visit the three rooms
which had been mysteriously marked Smoking Room, Non-Smoking Room, and Exam Room
since our arrival. Those who were familiar with certain properties of Scotch
like myself probably guessed at the difference between the two rooms and were
correct. The Non-Smoking room held the unpeated whiskies. In here I tried things
like the Macallan Cask Strength and the Clynelish 14 year, which was my favorite
of the non-smoking room. There was a third bottle in here but I can't recall
what it was as there was no room for it on the back of my shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smoking Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the room for me I knew it'd be awesome, what I didn't know was just how
awesome it would be. My notes rapidly begin to decline in quality in this room.
So I know the scotches were excellent. In here was an Ardbeg 12 Year, the
Laphroaig Murray McDavid, and again, a third which I cannot recall because I ran
out of room on the shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exam Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he introduced the other two rooms, Randall also introduced the exam room.
In this room there were a number of cups containing an unnamed spirit. Our goal
was to try some and identify in as much detail as we could, using the techniques
we learned from Craig, the spirit in the cups. Everyone would pitch their card
with their guess written on it into the pile and the winner would get a bottle
of something wonderful to bring home. I was one of the last people in the room
and submitted my scrawled flavor notes just as they were getting ready to pick
the winner. What I wrote follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cardamom, floral, juniper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost like a genever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no peat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47% - 55% a.b.v.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The instructions were to put as much detail as you could, so I rather
hubristically attempted to add some technical details in the hopes that it would
set me above the competition. It also proves I was pretty well into it that
evening. As it turns out, the exam room contained a gin rather than a whisky,
which had been aged in oak barrels. It was really good and I've been informed
that it's available at Bi-Rite in San Francisco and intend to make my way down
there to get a bottle for myself as in addition to my newly acquired scotch
habit I'm also a gin drinker. So I wasn't all that far from the mark and I have
to confirm with Randall but I'm pretty sure the alcohol content conforms to my
guess as well. However I didn't take first place since a gentleman from Engine
Yard had received a bottle of the very same gin for his birthday and had sampled
it the previous night. There are two possible reasons for the events which
followed. Either everyone else was way more drunk than I was, or I have an
incredibly silver-tongued alter ego when drunk. I managed to convince Randall
that A: The guy from Engine Yard kinda sorta cheated by having had some the
previous night, and B: There should really be a runner-up prize anyway. By the
strangest of coincidences I just so happened to be the runner-up. Fancy that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the night, they found an untouched bottle of the Murray McDavid to
award me with and I have been saving it for the launch of my side project which
I will talk about in a later post when it's closer to being done. Right now the
powers that be (school) have conspired to take all of my free time and replace
it with homework. If there's any justice I should have it up and running by the
end of May, but Tanj!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fandabbydozy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say about it... well, the Fandabbydozy was brought from Scotland
under unusual circumstances but we drank all the evidence of it away so it
should be fine to discuss. It was excellent. Certainly the first time I'd had a
single cask whisky. I didn't pick up as many of the flavors described on the
bottle but I certainly did enjoy my first, and second, and third drams of this
bottle. (Randall was very generous with it though I tried to protest and let
other people enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo credit goes to Jacob Helwig.The originals are [here][1]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In the End&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a great night, I took home a bottle of Laphroaig for my
fanatical devotion to flavor and by the time I left I was sober enough that I
got back to Union Square without getting lost. Thanks again to everyone at
GitHub and Engine Yard, the CodeConf speakers, fellow volunteers and attendees,
and in particular to Tom and Theresa Preston-Werner, Jacob Helwig, Steve
Klabnick, and Chris Bertels, all of whom were a source of excellent conversation
throughout the weekend. It turns out Chris and I work in the same office suite,
with different folks and in opposite corners so I'll likely be pestering him
about Fancy for some time. And lastly, a HUUUGE thanks to Craig for his
fantastic presentation and excellent conversation. I look forward to having a
few drinks with you next time you're in San Francisco. If anyone would like more
detail on the scotches or topics I wrote up here, I urge them to ping
@whiskycraig on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an interesting day. I helped to start an International holiday in
Corenominal Day, stopped for coffee when I was already running late despite the
fact that I loathe being tardy, tolerated and even enjoyed some aspects of
classes today, and got stung by a wasp that got trapped in my beard while I was
cycling home. All in all, today was quite eventful. Though I still didn't get as
much done as I {needed,intended,wanted}. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wakemate: A Review After Three Months</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/15/the-wakemate-a-review-after-three-months/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-15T11:11:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/04/15/the-wakemate-a-review-after-three-months</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: The WakeMate is great, if you like waking up feeling rested or hate
wasting time sleeping then this is for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sleephacking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a hacker, and as you might surmise, there are a few stereotypes and
connotations associated with that word. The first being that I spend my nights
in front of a computer subverting corrupt governments and stealing half pennies
at a time from banks that will never miss them. While the latter half of this is
false, I do spend many nights, such as the full six it took to write this blog
post over the last three months, in front of a computer screen. The other half,
which you may be less aware of, is that hackers are notorious for refusing to
cave to the pressures of the outside, be it peer pressure, financial pressure,
or otherwise. When someone tells a hacker something is impossible, chances are
all you did was challenge them to make it so. As a result, any time someone in
my life tells me I need to sleep more often, I'm driven to improve my ability to
function on an absolute minimum of sleep necessary to sustain full cognitive
function and bodily health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accomplish this, I use a number of tools and tricks, the latest of
which is the [WakeMate][WM] from Y-Combinator company Perfect Third Labs. This
review has been a long time coming and not everything about my experience with
the WakeMate has been ponies and teddy bears, but enough of it has that I can't
say I'd enjoy returning to life before I was using it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want to mention before we dive straight in, is that I am not in
any way affiliated with WakeMate with the exception of working for another YC
company, loving their product, and being on the mailing list for their nightly
and beta Android clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let's dive right in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Does it Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WakeMate's device sits on your wrist at night and monitors your activity during
sleep. It breaks sleep down into awake, light, average, and deep sleep. It can
tell roughly when you're awake, sleeping lightly, or deeply with pretty good
anecdotal accuracy. By that I mean, any night when I've gotten up at four to
peel the cat off my face and chuck her out has registered on the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've never caught it in an outright lie, so I assume that the data it collects
is at least accurate enough for my purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to collecting all this data, the WakeMate will also act as a smart
alarm. If you tell it by when you need to be awake, it will do its best to wake
you up at the optimal time in your sleep cycle up to twenty minutes before the
time you gave. This is the killer feature. The idea that the alarm should get
you up as early as you need to be, but not on time. People are often harmed by
the snooze button as it drags out long periods of dozing in the morning which in
my experience, serve only to leave me feeling rushed rather than refreshed.
WakeMate in an ideal world eliminates the need for both the snooze button as
well as the true alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed about the WakeMate was its selection of alarm
tones. Normally when picking an alarm tone, I go with the most jarring, teeth
grinding, horrid noise I can find in the selection. I do this because I needed
to be properly motivated to turn the thing off and not just let it play.
However, the problem with this practice is that when you're woken up by the
sound of a truckload of pots and pans being dropped out a third story window,
you wake up in a jarred and horrid mood. But the WakeMate's selection of tones
doesn't have any jarring alarms, nor does it allow you to specify your own. This
was clearly done on purpose since part of the product's goal is to wake you up
as gently as possible. The WakeMate's alarm tones (all named for colors) all
begin in a soft pianissimo and gently crescendo to at most a mezzoforte. The
effect of which is more akin to being woken by a lover whispering in your ear
and not your younger brother hitting you with his shoes to let you know it's
time to get up for school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole product is designed to make you feel good when you wake up and
that is an mission which they have largely accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another component of the WakeMate is the Wakelytics site which helps you
track a your personal sleep score over time as well as give you the ability to
tag any night with specific comments. I've used everything from &lt;code&gt;coffee-10pm&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;couch&lt;/code&gt; though I've not actually looked much at what it does for me. That said,
if you like game mechanics, leaderboards, and sleeping. WakeMate's top sleepers
board might be the place for you to bathe in the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What doesn't it do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is both tricky and simple. Firstly, the WakeMate isn't a magic solution
that you wear on your wrist in order to ward off oversleep demons. If you're
that tired, you'll just sleep through it like any other alarm. It also
isn't the best at preserving your data on Android, there have been a number of
nights where I lost data due to bluetooth bugs, application crashes,
accidentally running the device battery out, and so on. While the betas have
been getting better and better about this, it'd still be nice to have a fallback
such as not deleting data on power cycle but instead having a dedicated (and
somewhat hard to push) reset button. Beyond that, there isn't much advertised
that it doesn't deliver. At this point I think they're on the right path and
just need to step up on the user experience side&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I'd like to see&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature that WakeMate lacks for my desired use case is something I'm
going to call a Powernap Button (Feel free to use this if you like fellows.)
Which will let me sleep for a single light -&amp;gt; medium -&amp;gt; heavy -&amp;gt;
medium -&amp;gt; light sleep cycle and then wake me up. Especially on nights which
would otherwise have to be all nighters, this would be massively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another awesome feature would be an API to access live WakeMate data
about my current sleep. It'd be great to wire up the electric kettle to start
heating up once I've entered light sleeping and will soon be woken up and a
million other neat tricks like  beyond that all they really need is a bit of
user side polish and the willingness of people to try new things in order to
free themselves of the snooze button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WakeMate is a great tool if you want to tweak your sleeping habits and get
more out of less sleep. I haven't yet taken full advantage of all it has to
offer and the Android client is a little haphazard but constantly getting
better. I'd love to be able to hit a website with a request and get back some
json data of about my current sleep status. That would be fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Comments from the Posterous Version&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jon Schwartz&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for a little while now too (I think I was in
the second shipment). I have also found the wrist band to be too tight, so I
turned it inside out as some people suggested on the WM Blog, that solved the
issue. However, it caused another side issue. Now, the wrist band turns off in
the middle of the night (switch gets flipped) and I get woken up at the end
time instead of the correct time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software has gotten much better since version 1 (on Droid 1) and my data
hasn't been lost lost in quite a while. Sometimes, I'll have to power cycle
the wrist band, but it doesn't lose my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, their interface on Android needs a little more spit and polish and I,
too, would love api access. I doubt, however, they could offer us real time
access as I think the wrist band goes into low power mode when it doesn't
detect movement and its not close to wake up time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also that whole situation with the exploding usb charger. I haven't
gotten a replacement, have you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I agree with your assessment. The wakemate is a great tool, but I
still haven't shut off my backup alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;K|O|G|I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been using the wakemate for almost a month now. I didn't get a charger
with my shipment at all. When I emailed them about it, they said they had
issues with them, and are no longer including them &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; -- they told me
to check Amazon.com and buy one for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steven! Ragnarök&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Jon, I haven't gotten a replacement either, but USB wall warts are a dime a
dozen in my household, so I hadn't even been using it when they sent out the
recall. There's lots of little things with the Android app, like not entering
portrait mode when I crack open the keyboard to type in my login info. Nothing
that makes it unusable in my opinion, but not pleasant by half. Especially not
when you're already half asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@KOGI it's a shame they sent you out to Amazon, they should at least recognize
one that they accept. So many of the adapters I've found on Amazon have
shorted out themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comments guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;hjwieland&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hy, thanks for your great review! Based on it I have bought a WakeMate, too.
I'm an Android user so it would be great to test the nightly Android client
builds. But I dont find the mailng list of WakeMate you mentioned? Would be
great if you can point me to it. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Steven! Ragnarök&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@hjwieland it might just take them a while, They currently have one developer
doing all the work for both Android and Blackberry platforms. If you're
desperately impatient, post your email to @__nil on Twitter as he's the fine
fellow running the show. That seems to be the way the last few guys got in.
Remember that beta means beta which means occasional loss of data. If you
value the stats maybe you should stick with the Market versions. I'm not
fussed about the stats, which is why I volunteered to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;bev&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent post, I have found sleep success with the wakemate and have shaved
off about an hour a night without as much as a yawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're &quot;What I’d like to see&quot; rocks. I now want things to come alive just I am
waking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;bev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Computer Science Education in Silicon Valley</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-22T09:11:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2011/01/22/computer-science-education-in-silicon-valley</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;a.k.a: &lt;em&gt;Dear SJSU pls stop making me memorize the Java API, my degree is in
Comp. Sci. not JDK 1.6 kthxbaiSTFU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One would think that being in the heart of Silicon Valley, the very birthplace
of the personal computer, would be a colossal advantage to a student of computer
science and mathematics who is pursuing software development as a career. Sadly,
this is not the case. The curriculum and course materials taught by the two
local community colleges I've attended in the past and the university at which I
am enrolled is frightfully out of date. But not nearly as paleolithic as the
evaluation methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two kinds of computer science courses (10 different kinds
for those in the know), implementation classes and theory classes. The bulk of
my criticism here lies in theimplementation classes. When I started taking
programming classes in college, I began with Intro to Programming in Java and
Programming I in C++. My father, a games developer from days of yore took the
courses with me for laughs. In class, there was a computer at every seat, we
took our notes directly in the text editor, ran code that was being written on
the board live and often times had to correct errors in the professor's code
while he was writing it out. However, all our exams were handwritten and thus
there was no way to check our code against the compiler. In intro to programming
this isn't really a big deal, but later down the road in Object Oriented Design
and Patterns, we're being asked to write snippets of complex GUI programs
utilizing &lt;em&gt;__dozens))&lt;/em&gt; of standard library classes and methods. In one course,
the solution for this was a single laptop with the standard Java API
documentation on it that the students could wait in line for &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the exam.
In another, it is allowing each student to have a packet of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; 8.5 x 11 pages
on the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;th test of the semester.In this modern world where APIs are subject to
change and up-to-date documentation on every thing (except Ruby's Net::HTTP,
Oh Snap!) is readily available online, wasting brain-space memorizing API calls
is downright fscking stupid and I refuse to do it. This is another incarnation
of the classic fable &quot;Give a man a fish, he will pass a test. Teach him to RTFM,
he will actually be a software developer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have so far had only one class where the exam was to write a program, at a
computer and submit it in an inbox by the end of the class period. This is
absolutely the correct way to do things. The professor told us at the beginning
of the exam that perusing the docs (.Net) online was A-OK but that going
anywhere else would result in an F on the exam. He didn't even really walk
around and check. He had the wisdom to realize that cheaters will cheat and that
the internet can only help so much if you don't know what you're doing. Those
exams were not only more straightforward, fun, and challenging, but also the
most educational I have had within the realm of software development thus far
in the five years I've been a college student.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, if you're given the opportunity to teach a batch of computer
scientists, ask yourself if your class is about concepts or coding and if the
latter, write your test to be implemented on the computer in 90 minutes time.
None of their future employers give two shits about whether or not they know
what method to call on JDialog to get the output you want. That can be looked
up. They're looking for confident implementers who can pick up with a new
language or framework in an afternoon and get started right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I Try to Be Satisfied With Partial Credit and You Should Too</title>
    <link href="http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-07T11:42:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.nuclearsandwich.com/blog/2010/11/07/why-i-try-to-be-satisfied-with-partial-credit-and-you-should-too</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody knows about partial credit, partial credit is what happens when you
half-ass that essay, or forget to start that assignment until the morning before
its due. Sometimes, partial credit comes at you completely out of the blue, when
you thought you had the assignment in the bag. If you're professor is really out
to get you, then they will only give &quot;full credit&quot; for &quot;outstanding work&quot;,
whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got partial credit in early elementary school because I picked things up
rather quickly and once I'd gotten the hang of things, I stopped working at them
and went back to Mario or Sonic. I got partial credit in late elementary and
middle school because I didn't understand the value of what I was learning at
the time. I got partial credit in high school because there were far too many
things more fun than doing all the assignments or studying for the tests and
quizzes. I get partial credit in college because I work for a living, and like
it, and try to maintain the shambles that is my personal life. I've never been
the sort to focus on school, but that doesn't mean I don't agonize every time I
get an assignment back with less than perfect. Autograded assignments such as
those for calculus and physics, or most horribly, an online submission for a
computer program, which gives you instant and mercilessly objective feedback.
Well, it's like a drug, like failing to get the high score when the initials
you're trying to beat are those of the jock kid who used the allowance from his
rich parents to woo away your girlfriend. I just keep putting quarters in until
I'm completely tapped. I recently sent an email to one of my professors because
the amount of out-of-class work for their class for one week exceeded the time I
spent sleeping and doing work for all my other classes combined for that week,
which anyone must be forced to admit, is a little absurd. The reply I got was
simply this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;just do the best you can, and call it a day. Everyone is subjected to the
same thing...  You don't need to get every single point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don't need to get every single point. In my estimation, there are two*
primary reasons professors assign as much as they do. Either they firmly believe
that their class is the only one you should be taking that semester and that you
aren't doing anything else or they've completely forgotten the insanity of
undergraduate studies. So you can see that getting such a candid admission that
collecting all the points is not necessary to knowing the material. And indeed,
I had a week previously received the highest grade in the class on the exam.
(45/50, not all the pointseven then.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes two hands to count the number of times I conciously took partial credit
in the last month. Sometimes it was to study harder for another class or
complete an assignment that was weighted more heavily, sometimes it was to wrap
up a project for work, and other times it was just because the coffee was hot,
the conversation good and I didn't want to pull out my books and give up the
conversation. Some nights I just wanted to put in a full night's rest. But I do
it, I try to use it sparingly, but I'm also not going to commit ritual suicide
when that ugly &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; shows up on my transcript at the end of the semester. A
complete stranger might see that and see a student who &quot;didn't apply himself
fully&quot; or some other nonsense. But my girlfriend will see it as the week I spent
visiting her, my employer will see it as the projects I stayed up all night
finishing to be ready the next morning, and my old friend will see it as the
rainy afternoon at the coffee house we spent catching up and ignoring the world.
I'll see it as a representation of the rewards for my effort in balancing the
many aspects of my life and I'll have the knowledge of what I learned to judge
for myself what portion of the education offered I took for myself. I generally
find that I got what I wanted and often much much more. So, the next time you're
faced with a choice between catching up with an old friend, or getting a full
night's sleep for the first time in a month, and getting a passing grade or full
credit on an assignment, just remember: &quot;You don't need to get every single
point.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*There is a third less common reason that is quite popular with math teachers
and that is that C is defined as average and is therefore where they want most
of their students to fall with a standard bell curve around it and grading
convention be damned... sadists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I doubt there is anyone actually going to my website. I refuse to employ
silly Google Analytics for a toy site like my own. I'm in the unfortunate
position of being both rubbish at design, and very particular about it. Thus, I
do something with my website that I like at the time, and then can't bring
myself to go back to it because I know I won't like it and end up redoing it
from scratch, but I have all of these things I've been meaning to write down. I
guess I'll do it here. I picked posterous because I can just write myself emails
and they accidentally become public, so I better not talk about the money I've
stashed in the third tree on the left near the playground outside my old
school...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, a number of things have happened since I last wrote anything longer than
140 chars on the internet. The whole microblagging thing is one of them. I have
become somewhat enamored of identi.ca, my usage of which increased heavily after
I got a twitter account for my job. Not so much the format, though I do find it
a challenge against my natural verbosity, but the people. People make a social
network and Identi.cats are some of the coolest folk on the great wide online.
Having been inspired by the work and play of my fellow #neckbeards and free
software users, I decided to spend more time contributing back to community. I
think a lot of this will come in the form of documentation, bug reporting, and
baked goods for the locals. Part of this was reconstructing my online presence.
So here I am. I make no promises of regularity, nor about what content will
follow this, if any. But if I become moved to write about something, it will
more than likely manifest itself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, I guess I have a blog now,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steven!&lt;/p&gt;
